This is being done to avoid any possible\nconfusion with the HCL Domino brand. The family of malware that is described in this article is unrelated to,\ndoes not impact, nor uses HCL Domino or any of its components in any way. The malware is not associated\nwith HCL or its Domino product suite in any way.\n\n_This blog was made possible through contributions from Christopher Caridi._\n\nIBM Security X-Force recently discovered a new malware family we have called “Minodo,” which we assess\nwas created by developers associated with the cybercriminal group that X-Force tracks as ITG14, also\nknown as FIN7. Former members of the Trickbot/Conti syndicate which X-Force tracks as ITG23 have been\nusing Minodo since at least late February 2023 to deliver either the Project Nemesis information stealer or\nmore capable backdoors such as Cobalt Strike.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nThis discovery highlights the intricate nature of cooperation among cybercriminal groups and their members:\n\n[Since late February 2023, Minodo Backdoor campaigns have been observed using the Dave Loader,](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/itg23-crypters-cooperation-between-cybercriminal-groups/)\nwhich we have linked to the Trickbot/Conti syndicate and its former members.\nMinodo’s code shows overlap with the Lizar (aka Tirion, Diceloader) malware family, leading us to\nsuspect that it was created by current or former ITG14 developers.\nOne of Minodo’s final payloads is the Project Nemesis infostealer. Project Nemesis was first advertised\non the dark web in December 2021, though has been rarely used since then.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Ex-Conti Members Deploy Minodo in Recent Campaigns\n\nFormer members of ITG23 (aka the Trickbot/Conti syndicate) are likely behind recent campaigns using the\nDave Loader to load Minodo Backdoor and probably collaborated with current or former ITG14 developers\nto purchase or use the new malware family. X-Force [previously assessed that Dave is one of several](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/itg23-crypters-cooperation-between-cybercriminal-groups/)\nloaders or crypters developed by members of the Trickbot/Conti group. Although the group has fractured,\nmany of its loaders/crypters — including Dave — have been maintained and continue to be used by factions\ncomposed of former Trickbot/Conti members, including Quantum, Royal, BlackBasta, and Zeon.\n\nThe Dave Loader has been used recently with several Cobalt Strike samples with the watermark\n[“206546002,” which X-Force and other security researchers — here and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/i/play-ransomware-s-attack-playbook-unmasks-it-as-another-hive-aff.html) [here — have associated with](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/from-royal-with-love-88fa05ff7f65)\ngroups composed of former members of the Trickbot/Conti syndicate, including Quantum and Royal.\nX-Force observed Dave-loaded Cobalt Strike samples using this watermark in suspected Royal\nattacks in fall 2022.\nDave Loader has also been used this year to load IcedID and Emotet, both of which serve as initial\naccess vectors for ransomware attacks from former Trickbot/Conti-affiliated factions.\n\nRecently observed Dave samples were discovered loading a new malware, which we have named Minodo\nBackdoor. This new backdoor gathers basic system information, which it then sends to the C2, and in return\nreceives an AES encrypted payload.\n\nIn most instances, the received payload was a second loader that was found to have code overlap with\nMinodo Backdoor, and as such we have dubbed it Minodo Loader. This loader contains an encrypted\npayload within its resources, which it decrypts using AES. The decrypted payload is a .NET infostealer,\nwhich identifies itself as ‘Nemesis Project.’\n\nThe Minodo Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems, suggesting\na more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will be downloaded on higher value targets instead of\nProject Nemesis.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Minodo’s Connections to ITG14\n\n[Analysis revealed that both the Minodo Backdoor and Loader share code overlap with the Lizar Malware,](https://bi-zone.medium.com/from-pentest-to-apt-attack-cybercriminal-group-fin7-disguises-its-malware-as-an-ethical-hackers-c23c9a75e319)\nalso known as Tirion and DiceLoader, which is attributed to the threat group ITG14 (FIN7). In addition to\nhaving similar coding styles and functionality, both Minodo and DiceLoader share the same configuration\n[structure and have similar bot ID formats. Lizar was reportedly first used in March 2020, when it was](https://www.prodaft.com/blog/detail/opblueraven-unveiling-fin7carbanak-part-i-tirion)\noriginally named Tirion, and has been observed in numerous ITG14 campaigns up to the end of 2022.\nMinodo has been active in the wild since at least October 2022, which notably is when Lizar observations\nbegan to decrease.\n\nX-Force researchers found additional evidence connecting Minodo Backdoor to ITG14’s Carbanak\nBackdoor. We identified Minodo Backdoor samples from December 2022, which used a different loader that\nwe have dubbed NewWorldOrder Loader. The samples used the name ThunderboltService.exe and\ndownloaded and loaded the Project Nemesis Stealer.\n\nAround the same time, we also uncovered NewWorldOrder Loader samples, with the same filename\n_ThunderboltService.exe, used to load the Carbanak Backdoor._ [Carbanak has been used by ITG14 since late](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/fin7-pursuing-an-enigmatic-and-evasive-global-criminal-operation)\n2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, X-Force analysts also observed that two of the Minodo Backdoor C2 addresses belonging to\nMivoCloud: 94.158.247[.]72 and 185.225.17[.]202 are very close to C2 addresses ITG14 has used\npreviously for SSH-based backdoors such as 94.158.247[.]23 and 185.225.17[.]220. While such overlap is\ninsufficient for attribution, it is nonetheless consistent with other evidence linking Minodo to an ITG14\ndeveloper and may indicate the latter’s preference for MivoCloud for at least some of their C2 addresses.\nMivoCloud has also been used to host Diceloader and Carbanak C2 servers.\n\nCollaboration between members of ITG14 and former members of ITG23 is not without precedent. Other\nresearchers — [here and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/evolution-of-fin7) [here — observed ITG14 attacks using Ryuk ransomware in 2020, which has been](https://www.truesec.com/hub/blog/collaboration-between-fin7-and-the-ryuk-group-a-truesec-investigation)\n[attributed to the Trickbot/Conti cybercrime syndicate, while others have also identified connections between](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/black-basta-ransomware-attacks-deploy-custom-edr-evasion-tools-tied-to-fin7-threat-actor/)\na FIN7 developer and tools used by the BlackBasta group, whose members also have ties to the former\nTrickbot/Conti syndicate.\n\n### Project Nemesis\n\nThe Project Nemesis infostealer has been active in the wild since December 2021, when it was offered for\nsale on several Dark Web forums. It can collect data from a range of web browsers, as well as applications\nincluding Steam, Telegram, Discord, cryptowallets, and VPN providers.\n\nMinodo has been used to install Project Nemesis since at least October 2022 — prior to its use in late\nFebruary 2023 by ex-Conti actors. This leads us to assess that the ITG14 members responsible for\ndeveloping Minodo probably had a relationship with Project Nemesis and offered Minodo and the infostealer\n\n\n-----\n\nto the ex-Conti threat actors as a package. The ex-Conti members in turn likely used the Project Nemesis\ninfostealer against lower value targets.\n\nThe use of infostealers by former Trickbot/Conti members and their distributors is not without precedent —\n[other security researchers observed the Vidar infostealer delivered during DEV-0569 Batloader campaigns](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/17/dev-0569-finds-new-ways-to-deliver-royal-ransomware-various-payloads/)\nthat also led in some cases to Cobalt Strike and Royal ransomware. We assess that infostealers may often\nbe deployed during lower priority infections, e.g., on personal computers or those not belonging to an Active\nDirectory domain, while higher priority infections receive other backdoors such as Cobalt Strike.\n\n## Malware Deep Dive\n\nThis section contains a deeper look at the Dave Loader, Minodo Backdoor, Minodo Loader, and Project\nNemesis Infostealer malware.\n\n### Dave Loader\n\nThe sample analyzed for the purpose of this report is a 64-bit executable with MD5 hash\n**2CC79806701F1A6E877C29B93F06F1BB and a reported compile date of 28 February 2023. This sample**\nis identified as a variant of Dave Loader, a crypter linked to threat group ITG23 and more commonly\nobserved with payloads such as Emotet.\n\nThis sample has two encrypted resources within a resource directory named “XKLKLCRTE.” Dave Loader\nloads the resources using the API calls LdrFindResource_U and LdrAccessResource, and decrypts them\nusing XOR and the key mh8ZqMlTsaDYBZe7ma\\x00.\n\nThe smaller payload, with resource ID 3412, is a shellcode blob that contains code designed to load a PE\nfile. The second payload, with resource ID 6732, is a PE file. Dave Loader executes the decrypted shellcode\nand passes the PE payload to it, which the shellcode then loads and executes.\n\n### Minodo Backdoor\n\nThe loaded payload is a 64-bit DLL written in Visual C++, with MD5 hash\n**CDBE0FEB82B1CAF164C7DA42CB9A20BE. The payload was found to be a hitherto unknown backdoor,**\nwhich will be referred to as Minodo Backdoor.\n\nUpon execution, Minodo Backdoor starts by generating a Bot ID for the infected system by gathering the\nusername and hostname and creating a hash of the collected data, to which it then appends its current\nprocess id. For example, a648628c13d928dc-4480. This bot ID format is similar to that generated by Lizar,\nwhich also used a checksum of system information, combined with the process ID. However, Lizar used a\nCRC algorithm to create its hash, whereas Minodo uses a custom algorithm which XOR’s multiple values\ntogether. Interestingly, Lizar used a similar XOR-based algorithm as part of its encryption mechanisms\nduring communication with the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 1 — Minodo Backdoor system ID generation_\n\nThe malware then proceeds to decrypt its configuration block, which is stored in the data section of the\nbinary. The config is decrypted using XOR and a 16-byte key which is stored immediately before the\nencrypted config block. In this case the key is {03 9B 54 72 17 D3 5E E6 E0 E9 EF E0 DF 36 0D 79}.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 2 — Minodo Backdoor config decryption_\n\nIn the analyzed sample the decrypted config contains two pipe-delimited IP addresses, 88.119.175[.]124\nand 94.158.247[.]72. This is the same format used by Lizar to store its configuration.\n\n00000000 38 38 2e 31 31 39 2e 31 37 35 2e 31 32 34 7c 39 |88.119.175.124|9|\n\n00000010 34 2e 31 35 38 2e 32 34 37 2e 37 32 00 6e ee 99 |4.158.247.72.nî.|\n\n00000020 37 b1 2d 84 e5 8d 6a 70 21 3e d5 21 2c c1 37 b5 |7±-.å.jp!>Õ!,Á7µ|\n\n00000030 1f b7 09 f3 9b 0a c7 fe 53 32 23 6a 8c b0 4e 22 |.·.ó..ÇþS2#j.°N”|\n\nScroll to view full table\n\nA second config block, which is decrypted separately, contains an RSA public key.\n\nThe malware generates a random 32-byte key, which it encrypts using the RSA key. It then attempts to\nconnect to the C2 via TCP port 443 and send the encrypted key. Prior to the C2 connection, the malware\nchecks whether the host system is connected to a domain. If the system is detected as being domain joined,\nthen the malware uses the second IP address from the config to connect to the C2, otherwise, it defaults to\nthe first.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the initial connection is successful, the malware then proceeds to gather basic system information,\nincluding username, computer name, and OS version, which it then encrypts using AES-256-CBC and the\ngenerated, shared key (null bytes used for IV).\n\nAn example of the unencrypted data structure, which the malware sends to the C2, can be seen below.\n\n00000000 39 00 00 00 0b 15 61 36 34 38 36 32 38 63 31 33 |9…..a648628c13|\n\n00000010 64 39 32 38 64 63 2d 34 34 38 30 03 01 0a 00 00 |d928dc-4480…..|\n\n00000020 00 5a 29 00 00 0c 32 39 46 65 58 73 6b 64 70 4c |.Z)…29FeXskdpL|\n\n00000030 59 67 0a 76 6e 50 78 53 46 65 6f 4e 4e      |Yg.vnPxSFeoNN|\n\nScroll to view full table\n\nThis structure breaks down as follows:\n\n**Offset** **Size (bytes)** **Contents** **Description**\n\n0x0 4 0x00000039 Size of structure\n\n0x4 1 0x0B Hardcoded value 0xB (11)\n\n0x5 1 0x15 Size of system id string\n\n0x6 21 a648628c13d928dc-4480 System ID string\n\n0x1B 1 0x03 Value indicating presence of domain string\n\n0x1C 1 0x01 Unknown\n\n0x1D 1 0x0A OS Major version (10)\n\n0x1E 1 0x00 OS Minor version\n\n0x1F 2 0x0000 Unknown\n\n0x21 4 0x5a290000 OS Build Number (0x295A = 10586)\n\n0x25 1 0x0C Size of computer name string\n\n0x26 12 29FeXskdpL Computer Name\n\n0x32 1 0x0A Size of username string\n\n\n-----\n\n**Offset** **Size (bytes)** **Contents** **Description**\n\n0x33 10 vnPxSFeoNN Username\n\nScroll to view full table\n\nThe malware first sends 4 bytes to the C2 that contain a XOR-encrypted value, which is the size of the data\nto follow, and then sends the AES-encrypted system data.\n\nThe malware then begins a loop of checking in with the C2 by first sending a 4-byte encrypted size, followed\nby a 16-byte AES-encrypted block, which decrypts to the following 5 bytes {01 00 00 00 ff}. It continues this\nevery second until it receives a response from the C2.\n\nWhen it receives a response, the malware expects the C2 to send 4 bytes containing the payload size,\nfollowed by the payload itself. The malware then decrypts the received payload using AES and the shared\nkey.\n\nThe decrypted data consists of a 4 byte size, followed by a single byte indicating either a command or the\nload method that the malware should use for the payload, followed by the payload data itself, if applicable.\n\nIf the command byte is 0x3, then the malware exits.\n\nIf the command byte is 0x7, then the malware enumerates the running processes on the system and\ncompiles a list of process names and IDs. This data is then encrypted using AES and returned to the C2.\n\nOtherwise, the malware proceeds to load and execute the received payload using the method indicated by\nthe load/command byte. The following methods are supported:\n\n**0x1 — Copy the payload into allocated memory within the current process and create a new thread to**\nexecute an export named ReflectiveLoader within the payload DLL.\n**0x4 — Save the payload to the %Temp% directory with a filename generated via**\n**GetTempFileNameA, and execute the file using CreateProcessA.**\n**0x5, 0x6 — Open process with process id provided with the downloaded data. Allocate space within**\nthe process and write the payload data to the process memory. Then create a new thread in the\nremote process to execute an export named ReflectiveLoader within the copied payload DLL. This\nmethod is likely intended to be used following command 0x7.\n\nIn the case of the analyzed sample, the received payload contained a DLL binary, and command 0x1 was\nspecified.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 3 — Minodo Backdoor command structure_\n\n### Overlap with Lizar Toolkit\n\nMinodo Backdoor shares a lot of overlap with malware associated with the Lizar Toolkit, which is attributed\nto threat group ITG14. The Lizar Toolkit consists of a backdoor/loader, a collection of modules/plugins which\ncan be executed by the loader, and C2 client and server applications. A detailed report on the Lizar Toolkit\n[can be found here.](https://bi-zone.medium.com/from-pentest-to-apt-attack-cybercriminal-group-fin7-disguises-its-malware-as-an-ethical-hackers-c23c9a75e319)\n\nIn addition to having similar coding styles and utilizing similar API calls, Minodo Backdoor uses the same\nconfiguration structure as the Lizar Loader. In both cases, a configuration block containing a pipe-delimited\nlist of IP addresses is decrypted using XOR and a 16-byte key which is stored immediately before the\nencrypted config.\n\nBoth malware families also generate system IDs in very similar manners. In the case of Minodo Backdoor a\nhash is generated from the system username and hostname and the process ID is appended. For example,\n**a648628c13d928dc-4480. The hashing algorithm is custom and appears to be based on an encryption**\nalgorithm used previously in the Lizar Loader. Lizar Loader also generates a system ID which consists of a\nhash of system data followed by the current process ID, however, it uses a CRC algorithm to create its hash.\n\nMinodo Backdoor also incorporates elements that appear in some of Lizar’s plugins. For example, the\nsystem information gathered by Minodo Backdoor and sent to the C2 matches the reported functionality of\nLizar’s Info32/Info64.dll plugin. Also, the function within Minodo Backdoor to enumerate running processes\n\n\n-----\n\nand send a list of process names and IDs back to the C2 is very similar to the functionality of Lizar s\nListProcesses32/ListProcesses64.dll plugin.\n\nFinally, Lizar’s Jumper32/Jumper64.dll plugin resembles the code within Minodo Backdoor, which is able to\nload a payload using several different methods, with the required one specified using a command ID\nnumber.\n\n### Minodo Loader\n\nThe payload received by the Minodo backdoor from the C2 during this analysis was a 64-bit DLL, written in\nC++, with MD5 hash 2373BE26018075847AEA51636B739F66 and an internal filename of\n**MultiRunDll64.dll. The payload was found to be a Loader with similarities to Minodo Backdoor, and will be**\nreferred to as Minodo Loader.\n\nMinodo Loader has one export named ReflectiveLoader that contains code taken from the well-known\n[ReflectiveDLLInjection project. When run, this code performs the steps needed to properly load the DLL into](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/blob/master/dll/src/ReflectiveLoader.c)\nmemory, and allows for DLL payloads to load themselves directly from memory into a host process.\n\nOnce loaded, Minodo Loader starts by loading an encrypted payload from its resources and decrypting it\nusing AES-256-CBC and a hardcoded key. The Microsoft WinCrypt library is used for AES encryption and\ndecryption by both Minodo Backdoor and Loader.\n\nThe decrypted data consists of 4 bytes containing the payload size, followed by a further 4 bytes containing\neither the entry point offset for the payload or a value indicating the load method which should be used,\nfollowed by the payload itself.\n\nIf the entry point/load field contains a positive value, then the loader allocates memory within the current\nprocess space, copies the payload data to it, and then executes it at the specified offset indicated by the\nfield value. This option is most likely used for shellcode payloads or further DLLs with ReflectiveLoader\nexports.\n\nIf the value of the load field is -1 then the loader allocates memory within the current process and then loads\nthe PE payload into it using the full PE loading procedure. It copies the headers, maps the individual PE\nsections, processes any relocations, loads the PE’s imports, and then executes the PE from its internally\nspecified entry point.\n\nFinally, if the load field is equal to zero or another negative number, the payload is loaded as a .NET\nassembly.\n\n### Nemesis Project Infostealer\n\nThe final payload loaded by Minodo Loader is a .NET assembly with MD5 hash\nD9FFB202D6B679E5AD7303C0334CD000 and identified as a ‘Project Nemesis’ infostealer. Project\nNemesis is a commodity malware written in .NET which was first advertised for sale on the dark web in\nDecember 2021, though it does not seem to be widely known and it is not frequently observed in the wild.\n\nThe sample was initially advertised with the following text:\n\n\n-----\n\n_!

Minodo\nBackdoor shares code overlap with the Lizar (aka Tirion, Diceloader) family of malware, developed by\nITG14. Since late February 2023, former members of ITG23 have been observed using Dave Loader with\nMinodo Backdoor during their campaigns, suggesting at least some level of collaboration between the two\ngroups. The use of malware with ties to multiple groups in a single campaign — such as Dave Loader,\nMinodo Backdoor and Project Nemesis Infostealer — highlights the complexity involved in tracking threat\nactors but also provides insight into how and with whom they operate.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n**Indicator** **Indicator**\n**Type**\n\nde9b3c01991e357a349083f0db6af3e782f15e981e2bf0a16ba618252585923a SHA256\nHash\n\n\n**Context**\n\nDave Loader /\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Indicator**\n**Type**\n\nb14ab379ff43c7382c1aa881b2be39275c1594954746ef58f6a9a3535e8dc1a8 SHA256\nHash\n\ndbdfc3ca5afa186c1a9a9c03129773f7bc17fb7988fe0ca40fc3c5bedb201978 SHA256\nHash\n\nce99b4c0d75811ce70610d39b1007f99560e6dea887a451e08916a4f8cf33678 SHA256\nHash\n\nf1817665ea2831f775e23cbda27cbeb06d03e6c39bbfad920b50f40712dd37cb SHA256\nHash\n\n51e0512a54640be8e3477363c8d72d893c6edd20399bddf71e95eec3ddfdb42e SHA256\nHash\n\nf4ebd59fb578a0184abf6870fc652210d63e078a35dace0a48c5f273e417c13d SHA256\nHash\n\n92651f9418625e5281b84cccb817e94e6294b36c949b00fcd4046770b87f10e4 SHA256\nHash\n\ne5af0b9f4650dc0193c9884507e6202b04bb87ac5ed261be3f4ecfa3b6911af8 SHA256\nHash\n\n\n**Context**\n\nDave Loader /\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\nDave Loader\n/Minodo\nBackdoor\n\nDave Loader\n/Minodo\nBackdoor\n\nNewWorldOrder\nLoader /\nCarbanak\nBackdoor\n\nNewWorldOrder\nLoader /\nCarbanak\nBackdoor\n\nNewWorldOrder\nLoader /\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\nNewWorldOrder\nLoader /\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\n\nhxxp://170.130.55[.]250/x64.exe URL Staging URL for\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\nhxxps://upperdunk[.]com/mr64.exe URL Staging URL for\nMinodo\nBackdoor\n\n\n88.119.175[.]124 IP\nAddress\n\n\nMinodo\nBackdoor C2\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n94.158.247[.]72 IP\nAddress\n\n178.23.190[.]73 IP\nAddress\n\n\n**Context**\n\nMinodo\nBackdoor C2\n\nCarbanak C2\n\n\nes-megadom[.]com Domain Project\nNemesis C2\n\n\n185.225.17[.]202 IP\nAddress\n\n5.182.37[.]118 IP\nAddress\n\n45.67.34[.]236 IP\nAddress\n\nScroll to view full table\n\n\nMinodo\nBackdoor C2\n\nMinodo\nBackdoor C2\n\nProject\nNemesis C2\n\n\nTo learn how IBM X-Force can help you with anything regarding cybersecurity including incident response,\nthreat intelligence, or offensive security services schedule a meeting here:\n\n[IBM X-Force Scheduler](https://www.ibm.com/security/services/incident-response-services?schedulerform)\n\nIf you are experiencing cybersecurity issues or an incident, contact X-Force to help:\n\nUS hotline 1-888-241-9812 Global hotline (+001) 312-212-8034.\n\n[Malware\n |](https://securityintelligence.com/category/topics/threat-hunting/) [Threat Hunting](https://securityintelligence.com/category/topics/threat-hunting/)\n[Charlotte Hammond](https://securityintelligence.com/author/charlotte-hammond/)\nMalware Reverse Engineer, IBM Security\n\nCharlotte is a malware reverse engineer for IBM Security's X-Force IRIS team.
