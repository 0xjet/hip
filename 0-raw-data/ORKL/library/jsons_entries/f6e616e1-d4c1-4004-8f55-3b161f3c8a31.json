They deploy Cobalt Strike for persistence,\nharvest credentials, spread laterally through the Windows domain, steal data, and ultimately\n\n\n-----\n\nencrypt devices.\n\nWhen encrypting files, the Royal encryptor will append the .royal extension to the file\nnames of encrypted files. For example, test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed to\ntest.jpg.royal, as shown below.\n\n**Files encrypted by the Royal Ransomware**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nA Royal victim also told BleepingComputer that they target virtual machines by directly\nencrypting their virtual disk files (VMDK). The threat actors then print out the ransom notes\non network printers or create them on encrypted Windows devices.\n\nThese ransom notes are named README.TXT and contain a link to the victim's private Tor\nnegotiation page at royal2xthig3ou5hd7zsliqagy6yygk2cdelaxtni2fyad6dpmpxedid.onion.\nXXX in the ransom note below has been redacted but is unique to the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Royal ransom note**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe Tor negotiation site is nothing special, simply containing a chat screen where a victim\ncan communicate with the Royal ransomware operators.\n\nAs part of these negotiations, the ransomware gang will provide the ransom demand, with\nransom demands between $250,000 and over $2 million.\n\nThe ransomware gang will also commonly decrypt a few files for the victims to prove their\ndecryptor works and share file lists of the stolen data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Royal Ransomware Tor negotiation site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nBleepingComputer is unaware of successful payments and has not seen a decryptor for this\nransomware family.\n\nWhile the group claims to steal data for double-extortion attacks, it does not appear that a\ndata leak site has been launched under the Royal brand as of yet.\n\nHowever, it is strongly advised that network, windows, and security admins keep an eye out\nfor this group, as they are quickly ramping up operations and will likely become one of the\nmore significant enterprise-targeting ransomware operations.\n\n_Update 8/29/22: Article updated with some corrections, including launch date and callback_\n_phishing example._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Medibank now says hackers accessed all its customers’ personal data](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/medibank-now-says-hackers-accessed-all-its-customers-personal-data/)\n\n[TommyLeaks and SchoolBoys: Two sides of the same ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tommyleaks-and-schoolboys-two-sides-of-the-same-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[BlackByte ransomware uses new data theft tool for double-extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackbyte-ransomware-uses-new-data-theft-tool-for-double-extortion/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - September 30th 2022 - Emerging from the Shadows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-september-30th-2022-emerging-from-the-shadows/)\n\n[Hackers breach energy orgs via bugs in discontinued web server](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-energy-orgs-via-bugs-in-discontinued-web-server/)\n\n[CallBack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/callback/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Exploit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/exploit/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Royal Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/royal-group/)\n[Zeon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zeon/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
