The group shut down its\ninfrastructure after the US State\nDepartment offered a reward of $10\nmillion for information facilitating the\nidentification or localisation of group\nmembers in May 2022. It has likely\nreorganised since then as different\ngroups, possibly including BlackByte,\nBlackBasta, and Karakurt.\n\nSources: [2] [4] [8] [9]\n\n\nPrior to the war in Ukraine, the group has been “widely regarded as a semi-autonomous asset of the Russian\nintelligence services” by IT experts because its activity aligned with Russian security interests. Conti publicly\npledged their allegiance to the Russian government after the invasion of Ukraine in Spring 2022, but revoked\nit after serious backlash. However, leaked documents from February 2022 indicate that some members of\nthe group had informal ties to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Sources: [4] [5] [6]\n\n##### Agency type\n\n**State-tolerated cyber criminals, with patriotic sentiments. An IBM Security X-Force report from July 2022**\nnoted that the group’s targeting had evolved following Russia’s invasion to include Ukrainian entities.\nSources: [2] [6] [10]\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Most frequent targets:\n\n**Australia** **Bahamas** **Canada** **Costa Rica**\n\n**France** **Germany** **India** **Ireland**\n\n**Italy** **Japan** **Mexico** **New Zealand**\n\n**Spain** **Switzerland** **Taiwan** **United Kingdom**\n\n**Ukraine (since 2022)** **USA**\n\nAccording to the group’s data leak site, ransomware operations targeted nearly 800 organisations across 40\ncountries. The majority of victims are active in the manufacturing, legal and professional services,\nconstruction and engineering, and retail sectors. As the cybersecurity firm Mandiant observed, the large\nshare of North American targets (60%) may indicate a targeting pattern focused on North America. Sources: [7]\n\n[10] [12]\n\n##### Group composition/organisational structure\n\nThe Russia-based cyber-crime group ran a ransomware-as-a-service business model, employing multiple\naffiliates who oversee the penetration of their victims’ networks and file encryption. Usually, Russianspeaking affiliates were recruited from forums based on their experience, reputation, and activity level.\nSome affiliates paid Conti a commission ranging between 10-30% of their received ransom payments; others\nappeared to be part of a payroll system. The group regularly cooperated with other ransomware gangs such\nas Maze, LockBit 2.0, and Ragnar Locker. In August 2021, a former Conti affiliate “m1Geelka” leaked sensitive\ninformation about the group’s organisation, training, and leadership. A few team members' online identities\nhad been previously disclosed, including its leader/project frontman (“reshaev” aka “cybergangster”), Conti\nadmin (“Tokyo”), an assistant, and a recruiter (“IT-Work”).\n\nThe group publicly pledged allegiance to the Russian government after the invasion of Ukraine, causing a stir\nboth within the group (among Ukrainian members and Russians supporting Ukraine), as well as other threat\nactors (mostly other cyber criminals) that considered involvement in political issues a business risk. Following\nthis controversy, one of the Conti group members decided to leak private Conti chat logs and other internal\ninformation. Moreover, this pledge of allegiance led states to associate Conti with the Russian state, tying\nthe group to the severe sanctions regime imposed in response to the aggressions against Ukraine. Any victim\nmaking a ransom payment involving a designated individual or entity, including sanctioned financial\ninstitutions to process a transaction, risked violating the sanctions framework. In the US, a single violation\nof sanction provisions can result in fines of up to $1 million and a 20-year prison sentence. Although the\ngroup sought to walk back the significance of its pledge, the announcement caused irreparable damage to\nits business and reputation. On 19 May 2022, core infrastructure components to upload victim data and run\npayment negotiations were switched off. Security researchers at AdvIntel have observed a surge of activity\nacross a number of former Conti affiliates, suggesting a decentralisation away from Conti’s strong vertical\nhierarchy as the group’s core actors restructure their operations. BlackByte, BlackBasta, and Karakurt are\nsome of the suspected subsidiaries central in this reorganisation.

Operating as semi-automatic recovery service, the group uses\nautomatic network scans to identify valuable targets by spreading through compromised networks and\nencrypting every device and account it can find. In general, Conti uses many freely-available technologies,\noften developed for legitimate uses (e.g., Cobalt Strike, AnyDesk, Atera, or Tor), which the group abuses for\ncriminal purposes. Like other ransomware threat actors, the group employs a double extortion tactic, which\nthreatens the release of confidential data stolen by the group while exploring a victim’s network if the first\nransom demand to decrypt targeted systems is not met. The group is highly sophisticated, as reflected in the\nmonetising practices of Conti’s business operations, such as its money laundering techniques.\n\n##### Basic attack pattern\n\nConti changed and updated its attack pattern on an almost daily basis, using exploits for recently-discovered\nsoftware flaws and taking advantage of delayed patch deployments to target still-vulnerable networks.\nWithin these variations in the execution, a basic attack pattern has emerged:\n\n**(1)** **Target selection** (observed techniques: phishing, mass vulnerability scanning, high-end malware\n\ndistribution software, credential stuffing, fake websites, impersonating)\n\n**(2)** **Deployment and execution (installation of backdoors, identification of mission-critical systems, such**\n\nas domain controllers or backup servers, exfiltration of data)\n\n**(3)** **Encrypting the victim’s data (using randomly-generated keys)**\n\n**(4)** **Sending demand and initiating negotiation (sending a ransom note, providing communication for**\n\nnegotiations)\n\n##### Zero-Day exploits\n\nConti commonly employed known vulnerabilities. But in late 2020, the group used a purchased zero-day\nexploit in Internet Explorer 11.\n\n##### Malware used (non-exhaustive)\n\nConti v3.0 Trickbot Emotet\nBazarLoader ColbaltStrike Ryuk\nICEDID\n\nSources [11] [14] [15] [16]\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Select tactics and techniques leveraged by the group based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n\n##### MITRE Initial Access \n\nExternal Remote Services\nPhishing\n\n_Spearphishing attachment_\n_Spearphishing link_\nValid Accounts\n\n##### MITRE Persistence\n\nBoot or logon autostart execution\nCreate or modify system process\nScheduled task/job\nValid Accounts\n\n##### MITRE Defense Evasion\n\nFile and directory permissions modification\nImpair Defenses\nIndicator removal\nMasquerading\nModify Registry\nObfuscated files or information\nProcess injection\nSubvert trust controls\nValid Accounts\n\n##### MITRE Exfiltration\n\nExfiltration over alternative protocol\nExfiltration over C2 channel\n\n##### MITRE Impact\n\nData encrypted for impact\n\n\nService Stop\n\n\n-----\n\n### ATTRIBUTION\n\n\n##### Attribution milestones\n\n**2021** **AUG 2021** **FEB 2022**\n\n→ →\n\nProdraft Report Conti Playbook Leak Conti Leaks\n\n\nSources: [11] [17] [18]\n\n##### Attribution controversies\n\n**Wizard Spider/Conti/Ryuk:** CrowdStrike attributes operations with Conti and Ryuk malware to the same\nhigh-profile and sophisticated eCrime group, Wizard Spider. Other experts regard Conti and Ryuk as two\nseparate threat actors that share very similar ransomware samples and bitcoin wallets, indicating a\nconnection between the two groups. Conti’s ransomware seems to be a continuation of the Ryuk\nransomware. One top-level Conti operative (senior manager) apparently had contact with and access to\nseveral members of Ryuk. It is a clear example of the frequent ambiguity in distinguishing threat actors and\nmalware samples, especially as criminal groups reorganise to avoid law enforcement.\n\n**Conti and UNC1756: The threat actor behind the deployment of Conti ransomware against the government**\nof Costa Rica in April referred to itself as UNC1756 when it announced the operation. UNC – short for\nuncategorised – is a nod to the designation used by Mandiant for clusters of intrusion activity that cannot\nyet be linked to an identified group. Updates regarding the attack signed by UNC1756 and published via\nConti’s dark web PR page raised questions as to whether Conti’s leadership was highlighting the work of an\naffiliate or whether UNC1756 was a stunt deliberately made to distract law enforcement and security\nresearchers with a fake identity.\n\n**Conti and Maze: Researchers at Intel 471 found copied features from Maze malware in Conti’s codes. Conti**\ntop-level developers were reportedly in close contact with Maze developers while the Conti malware was\nstill in development itself.\n\nSources: [2] [5] [11] [19] [20]\n\n##### Attribution-/detection sensitivity\n\nConti is known for its resilience and quick adoption of new techniques and tactics. The group adjusted its\nattack patterns almost daily, which is likely not a response to specific attributions but rather a preventive\nstrategy to avoid detection. Furthermore, the group used various obfuscation techniques and weekly code\nchanges to disrupt malware analysis systems. Sources: [2] [11]\n\n\n-----\n\n### LEGAL AND POLITICAL ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST THE GROUP\n\n\n##### Political/Legal/Law enforcement actions \n\nOn 6 May 2022, the US State Department announced a $10 million reward for information on Conti\nransomware co-conspirators under its Rewards for Justice program, first introduced as a counterterrorism\ninitiative. Sources: [13] [21] [22]\n\n##### Indicted individuals / sanctioned (associated) entities\n\nNo individuals indicted (as of November 2022)\n\n\n##### Landmark incidents\n\n**Irish healthcare shutdown 2021:**\nIreland’s Health Service Executive was hit by a major Conti ransomware attack, disrupting some health care services.\n\n**Conti’s ransomware attack on Costa Rica 2022:**\nConti breached several governmental institutions and agencies during a presidential transition, demanding a $10\nmillion ransom. The new president, Rodrigo Chaves, subsequently declared a national state of emergency. The\ngroup ultimately disclosed 97% of the data it had stolen from Costa Rican entities.\n\nSources: [4] [5] [25]\n\n\n-----\n\n### SOURCES\n\n\n\n[1] Baskin (2020), TAU Threat Discovery: Conti Ransomware, VMware Security Blog.
