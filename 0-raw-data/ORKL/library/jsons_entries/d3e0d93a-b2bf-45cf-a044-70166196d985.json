The now-deleted tweet followed a\n[familiar pattern, bringing echoes of cryptocurrency scams that used Musk’s name and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/22/scam-uses-elon-musk-name-trick-people-us2million-bitcoin/)\npromised to return double the amount of bitcoin sent:\n\n“I‘m feeling generous because of Covid-19. I’ll double any BTC payment sent to my BTC\naddress for the next hour. Good luck, and stay safe out there!” read the message that\nappeared on Musk’s account.\n\n_RELATED READING:_ _[What to do if your Twitter account has been hacked](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/03/20/what-to-do-twitter-account-hacked/)_\nA flurry of similar tweets were also sent out from the other hijacked handles; apparently,\nsome people fell for the ploy, since one of the cryptocurrency addresses has, as of the time\nof writing, [received 12.86 BTC (some US$117,000).](https://bitref.com/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh)\n\nWe are aware of a security incident impacting accounts on Twitter. We are\ninvestigating and taking steps to fix it. We will update everyone shortly.\n\n— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) [July 15, 2020](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283518038445223936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe social media giant took a number of steps to swiftly remedy the situation. This included\ntemporarily locking all compromised accounts, with Twitter stating that it would restore\naccess only when it could do so securely. In short order, the company went on to take the\nunprecedented step of temporarily locking down all verified accounts, i.e. accounts marked\nby a blue tick.\n\nWe also limited functionality for a much larger group of accounts, like all verified\naccounts (even those with no evidence of being compromised), while we continue to\nfully investigate this.\n\n— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) [July 16, 2020](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591850604015618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAll the while, Twitter sought to keep everyone appraised by maintaining a steady stream of\ntweets informing about the developing situation. Eventually, the company started restoring\nfunctionality to the accounts, allowing them to tweet again.\n\n## So, how did it all happen?\n\n\n-----\n\nObviously the key question that screams for an answer is: How was the massive hack\nexecuted?” According to the microblogging site, the incidents were caused by a social\nengineering attack on its employees:\n\nWe detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people\nwho successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems\nand tools.\n\n— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) [July 16, 2020](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283591846464233474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Meanwhile, a Motherboard article seems to suggest that there may be more to the story, as](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos)\nseveral confidential sources from the black-hat community told the site that they had\nactually paid a Twitter insider to do the job.\n\nIn response, a Twitter spokesperson told Motherboard that the company was looking into\nwhether the employee had possibly hijacked the account, or provided the cybercriminals\nwith access to the tool.\n\n_RELATED READING:_ _[Insider threats: A persistent and widespread problem](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/04/26/insider-threats-persistent-widespread-problem/)_\nESET Security Specialist Jake Moore put the issue into a broader context: “Acting like a\nhelp desk, these employee accounts were enabled to use a specific admin tool and do\nwhatever they wanted, which is likely to be a problem for many businesses. Some\norganizations lend an incredible amount of trust to certain employees. However, although\nthey may be trusted not to compromise an account themselves, it must be taken into\nconsideration that the employees will be targeted by criminal hackers.”\n\nHe also had some advice to share urging Twitter users to watch out for online scams:\n“When a message seems too good to be true it probably is, regardless of who has posted it.\nBitcoin doubling schemes are synonymous with the criminal fraternity and must be avoided\nand reported where possible.”\n\n16 Jul 2020 - 04:40PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n\n-----\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n-----",
