Impact and operational assessments\nof ransomware in this report derive from responding and protecting these environments\ndaily.\n\nDragos published a previous version of this report for threat intelligence customers on 14\nJanuary 2020. Due to the public interest in this ransomware, we are releasing the full report\nto the public.\n\n**NOTE: Since publication, Dragos was informed by an independent researcher that EKANS**\nactually contains a far larger list of processes to kill than initially understood.[a] Further\nexamination shows the process list overlaps with the MegaCortex list cited earlier in this\npost, indicating significant continuity between these samples, with EKANS only adding\nobfuscation and encoding to make the process list non-obvious to researchers.[b] Based on\nthis information, EKANS remains an interesting threat to ICS-specific processes but\nappears to be a continuation of a trend dating back to at least the summer of 2019.\n\n[[a]W3ndige – Twitter](https://twitter.com/w3ndige/status/1233388947411263492)\n\n[b] [Script and the decoded strings from the EKANS/Snake ransomware – GitHubGist](https://gist.github.com/W3ndige/0e741c4e04555e67b2219b1a2885852c)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nEKANS ransomware emerged in mid-December 2019, and Dragos published a private\nreport to Dragos WorldView Threat Intelligence customers early January 2020. While\nrelatively straightforward as a ransomware sample in terms of encrypting files and\ndisplaying a ransom note, EKANS featured additional functionality to forcibly stop a number\nof processes, including multiple items related to ICS operations. While all indications at\npresent show a relatively primitive attack mechanism on control system networks, the\nspecificity of processes listed in a static “kill list” shows a level of intentionality previously\nabsent from ransomware targeting the industrial space. ICS asset owners and operators\nare therefore strongly encouraged to review their attack surface and determine mechanisms\nto deliver and distribute disruptive malware, such as ransomware, with ICS-specific\ncharacteristics.\n\nUpon discovery and investigation, Dragos identified a relationship between EKANS and\nransomware called MEGACORTEX, which also contained some ICS-specific\ncharacteristics. The identification of industrial process targeting within the ransomware\ndescribed in this report is unique and represents the first known ICS-specific ransomware\nvariants.\n\nEKANS underscores the importance for asset owners and operators to achieve visibility into\ntheir assets. By taking stock of available assets and connections within an environment,\nasset owners can understand the potential consequences of an adversary deploying ICS\n\n-----\n\nspecific ransomware against a certain asset, the impact to operations or related processes,\nand take measures to defend against them.\n\n## EKANS Background and Discovery\n\nDragos initially learned of a new ransomware variant, called “Snake” or “EKANS”, on 06\nJanuary 2020. [1] After alerting impacted parties and reporting to Dragos WorldView\ncustomers on 14 January 2020, the malware received additional media coverage on 28\nJanuary 2020. [2]\n\n**_Analyst Note: Although referred to as both Snake and EKANS in public reporting_**\n_(“EKANS” being “Snake” spelled backwards), Dragos will refer to this malware as EKANS_\n_due to the existence of other malware previously discovered and labeled as “Snake” and_\n_attributed to the Turla threat actor. [3] Any further or future reference to “Snake” by Dragos_\n_will refer to Turla-associated activity, while the ransomware variant under discussion will be_\n_referenced as EKANS._\n\nWhile investigating EKANS, Dragos observed a list of processes associated with industrial\ncontrol system operations (ICS). The malware was designed to terminate the named\nprocesses on victim machines. This is notable for EKANS because while ransomware has\npreviously victimized ICS environments, prior events all feature IT-focused ransomware that\nspreads into control system environments by way of enterprise mechanisms. [4] Otherwise,\nICS-specific ransomware has mostly included either academic proof of concepts or\nmarketing stunts representing the corpus of activity. [5]\n\nGiven the unique (if limited) nature of EKANS for ICS operations, Dragos provides the\nfollowing analysis.\n\n**With a limited set of ICS-specific malware in existence, EKANS, though**\n**primitive, represents an evolution in adversaries targeting control system**\n**environments.**\n\nAs a result, even though much recent public reporting on the subject has been hyperbolic in\nnature, the following covers publicly available information on the first known ICS-specific\nransomware examples.\n\n## EKANS Ransomware Analysis\n\nEKANS is an obfuscated ransomware variant written in the Go programming language, first\nobserved in commercial malware repositories in late December 2019. The only known,\nrelevant sample has the following characteristics:\n\nFile Name: update.exe\n\nMD5: 3d1cc4ef33bad0e39c757fce317ef82a\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA1: f34e4b7080aa2ee5cfee2dac38ec0c306203b4ac\n\nSHA256: e5262db186c97bbe533f0a674b08ecdafa3798ea7bc17c705df526419c168b60\n\nAnalysis of the binary indicates multiple, custom Go libraries are used to construct and\nensure execution, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n**_Figure 1: References to Custom Golang Files in EKANS Binary_**\nOn its own, the binary consists of multiple encoded strings. However, the encoding schema\ncan be identified and reversed, and publicly available analysis was provided as early as 07\nJanuary 2020. [6] Reviewing the encoded strings along with monitoring malware execution\nin a sandbox environment identifies the ransomware’s program flow.\n\nFirst, the malware checks for the existence of a Mutex value, “EKANS”, on the victim. If\npresent, the ransomware will stop with a message “already encrypted!”. Otherwise, the\nMutex value is set and encryption moves forward using standard encryption library\nfunctions. Primary functionality on victim systems is achieved via Windows Management\nInterface (WMI) calls, which begins executing encryption operations and removes Volume\nShadow Copy backups on the victim.\n\nBefore proceeding to file encryption operations, the ransomware force stops (“kills”)\nprocesses listed by process name in a hard-coded list within the encoded strings of the\nmalware. A full list with assessed process function or relationship is provided in Appendix A\n\n\n-----\n\nof this report. While some of the referenced processes appear to relate to security or\nmanagement software (e.g., Qihoo 360 Safeguard and Microsoft System Center), the\nmajority of the listed processes concern databases (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server), data\nbackup solutions (e.g., IBM Tivoli), or ICS-related processes.\n\nICS products referenced include numerous references to GE’s Proficy data historian, with\nboth client and server processes included. [7] Additional ICS-specific functionality\nreferenced includes GE Fanuc licensing server services and Honeywell’s HMIWeb\napplication. [8] Remaining ICS-related items consist of remote monitoring (e.g., historianlike) or licensing server instance such as FLEXNet and Sentinel HASP license managers\nand ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity Suite. [9] As indicated previously, the malware\nperforms no action other than forcibly stopping the referenced process. As such, the\nmalware has no capability to inject commands into or otherwise manipulate ICS-related\nprocesses. However, execution on the right system (e.g., a data historian) would induce a\nloss of view condition within the network.\n\nFiles are renamed after encryption by appending a random five character (upper- and\nlower-case letters) to the original file extension. For example, as shown in Figure 2, Python\nPYD files are encrypted and additional characters added to the PYD extension.\n\nFigure 2: EKANS Encryption Results\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing process stop and encryption actions, EKANS drops a ransom note to the root of\nthe system drive (typically C:\\) and the active user’s desktop. The ransom note is provided\nin Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: EKANS Ransom Note\n\nUser access to the encrypted system is maintained throughout the process, and the system\ndoes not reboot, shutdown, or close remote access channels. This differentiates EKANS\nfrom more disruptive ransomware such as the LockerGoga variant deployed at Norsk Hydro\nin March 2019. [10] The email address in the ransomware uses a privacy-focused email\nservice, similar to Protonmail, called CTemplar. [11]\n\n**_Analyst Note: The response email, bapcocryp[AT]ctemplar[.]com, appears similar to_**\n_Bapco, the Bahrain state oil company._ _[12] Recent reporting claims that Bapco was the_\n_victim of the late December 2019 ZeroCleare wiper variant Dustman. [13] While the email_\n_address is provocative in light of this news, the EKANS sample appears unrelated to the_\n_Dustman event. The EKANS sample was first identified in a commercial virus repository on_\n_26 December 2019, while the Dustman event took place on 29/30 December 2019. One_\n_possibility is that EKANS was in fact used at Bapco in an incident prior to Dustman, while_\n_another is that current public reporting is confusing the Dustman incident (which all_\n_available information indicates is focused on Saudi Arabia) with a widespread and_\n_potentially disruptive ransomware event at Bapco occurring around the same time. In either_\n_case, any links between EKANS, the Bapco incident, and the Dustman wiper appear_\n_circumstantial given available evidence._\n\nEKANS possesses no built-in propagation or spreading mechanism. The malware must\ninstead be launched either interactively or via script to infect a host. As such, EKANS\nfollows a trend observed in other ransomware families such as Ryuk and MEGACORTEX\namong others, where self-propagation is avoided in favor of performing large-scale\ncompromise of an enterprise network. Once achieved, ransomware can be seeded and\nscheduled throughout the network via script, Active Directory compromise, or some other\nmechanism to achieve simultaneous infection and system disruption.\n\n\n-----\n\n## EKANS Relationship to MEGACORTEX\n\nWhile researching EKANS and the processes identified in Appendix A, Dragos made a\nconnection to another ransomware family, MEGACORTEX. [14] Process kill activity similar\nto EKANS was observed in a newer, “version 2” variant of MEGACORTEX in mid-2019, as\npublicly analyzed and reported by Accenture. [15] The specific MEGACORTEX sample that\nalso references ICS processes has the following characteristics:\n\nMD5: 53dddbb304c79ae293f98e0b151c6b28\n\nSHA1: 2632529b0fb7ed46461c406f733c047a6cd4c591\n\nSHA256: 873aa376573288fcf56711b5689f9d2cf457b76bbc93d4e40ef9d7a27b7be466\n\nWhile the list of processes targeted in EKANS is relatively short and focused (64 total\nitems), the newer version of MEGACORTEX contains over 1,000 referenced items. The\nvast majority of the processes listed relate to security solutions or similar tools. However, all\nof the items referenced in the EKANS ICS list are also present in the MEGACORTEX list,\nand no additional items are present in the MEGACORTEX list with ICS significance. Based\non this information, it appears EKANS is not unique, or at least not first, in targeting ICSrelated processes.\n\n**Instead EKANS represents an obfuscated, hardened ransomware variant based**\n**on prior MEGACORTEX activity.**\n\n## ICS Significance and Implications\n\nPast concerns with ransomware in ICS environments focused on propagation mechanisms.\nEssentially, IT-focused ransomware could impact control system environments if they could\nmigrate into Windows-based portions of control system networks, thus disrupting\noperations. As such, any ICS disruption caused by ransomware represented the results of\noverly-aggressive malware propagation leading to ICS impacts.\n\nEKANS (and apparently some versions of MEGACORTEX) shift this narrative as ICSspecific functionality is directly referenced within the malware. While some of these\nprocesses may reside in typical enterprise IT networks, such as Proficy servers or Microsoft\nSQL servers, inclusion of HMI software, historian clients, and additional items indicates\nsome minimal, albeit crude, awareness of control system environment processes and\nfunctionality.\n\nThe actual level of impact EKANS or ICS-aware MEGACORTEX may have on industrial\nenvironments is unclear. Targeting historian and data gathering processes at both the client\nand server level imposes significant costs on an organization and could induce a loss of\nview condition within the overall plant environment. The impacts for licensing server and\n\n\n-----\n\nHMI process termination are less clear, as other processes may still be in play to enable\nfunctionality and fallbacks or “grace periods” for licensing servers may enable continued\noperations for some time absent the license management system.\n\n**_“EKANS and its presumed parent MEGACORTEX variant represent a unique_**\n**_and specific risk to industrial operations not previously observed in_**\n**_ransomware malware operations.”_**\n\nNonetheless, this uncertainty remains unacceptable given the possibility to produce\ninadvertent loss of control situations depending on precise environment configuration and\nprocess links. As a result, EKANS and its presumed parent MEGACORTEX variant\nrepresent a unique and specific risk to industrial operations not previously observed in\nransomware operations. While some organizations have the emergency recourse of falling\nback into “manual mode” operations, the costs and inefficiencies of doing so (if such a\nchange-over happens absent friction) are still substantial. Given these aspects, EKANS and\nits parent present specific and unique risks and cost-imposition scenarios for industrial\nenvironments.\n\n## Evaluating Alleged Links to Iran\n\nOne particular item of interest in both the vendor blog post [16] and Bloomberg article [17]\non EKANS activity is an emphasis on supposedly proven links to “Iranian strategic\ninterests.” While any connection to “strategic interests” are possible given the size and\nscope of most states’ long-term strategy, Dragos analysis finds any such link to be\nincredibly tenuous based upon available evidence. Arguments offered in favor of Iranian\ninvolvement include overlap with previously reported Dustman wiper activity, presumed\nunlikelihood of having overlapping intrusions in the same environment at the same time,\nand alleged technical similarities between EKANS and known Iran-linked operations.\n\n**In all three cases, current evidence does not support asserting an association**\n**with Iranian cyber operations.** [18]\n\nFirst, the correlation with Dustman is odd as all available evidence indicates Dustman took\nplace at the end of December 2019 while EKANS appears to have been active in midDecember 2019. Furthermore, Dustman authoritative reporting emerged from Saudi Arabia\nand not Bahrain, implying Dustman activity largely focused on this country. [19] While\npossible that Bapco may have been impacted by both events, even if this is the case such\nan observation does not necessitate or even imply a link between events.\n\nWhich leads to the second concern, where vendor reporting and media quotes indicate it is\nunlikely two separate entities would be engaged in a victim environment simultaneously. Yet\nas seen in high-profile cases such as the 2016 Democratic National Committee intrusion,\n\n[20] such operations do exist, and a plethora of other cases indicate they may not be rare.\n\n\n-----\n\nThus, if Bapco did experience a Dustman event and Bapco is the victim of EKANS as well,\nthese two events represent a coincidence and prove no relationship or link to an overall\ncoordinating authority on their own.\n\nReferences are made in the two referenced sources on technical “markers” demonstrating\nEKANS similarity to Iran-linked events. Unfortunately, no such markers are present. Past,\npublicly-reported Iranian-associated IT disruptive activity exclusively focused on using\nDisttrack-like malware variants weaponizing the ElodS RawDisk driver to render victim\nmachines unusable, from the original Shamoon through ZeroCleare and Dustman. [21]\nAbsent any additional context, EKANS instead appears to be a fairly standard ransomware\nvariant, albeit with some additional concerning functionality. While there are examples of\nransomware-like malware being used as a means to achieve widespread destruction, [22]\nno evidence exists that EKANS was designed to mimic such functionality. Furthermore, past\nexperience both in cyber and physical realms (since Iranian-linked interests were happy to\nlaunch missiles and destructive drones against Saudi oil infrastructure in September 2019)\n\n[23] adds a significant burden to the argument such an actor would desire or need to\nobfuscate operations.\n\nOverall, no strong or compelling evidence exists to link EKANS with Iranian strategic\ninterests. While a link to Bapco is possible given the ransom email address, any further\ncorrelation to Iranian-associated activity is simply not supported by any available evidence.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nAt present, Dragos is not aware of how EKANS distributes itself within victim networks.\nPrimary defense against ransomware such as EKANS relies on preventing it from reaching\nor spreading through the network in the first place.\n\n## Host\n\nUnlike some other recent ransomware variants, EKANS is not code signed.\nImplementing controls in control system networks to prohibit the execution of\nunsigned binaries can therefore mitigate against the execution of malware such as\nthis. Unfortunately, many legitimate vendor software packages continue to be\ndistributed in unsigned form, so this mitigation strategy may not be practical in many\ninstances.\nSimilar to the above but relying on more generic mechanisms, organizations can\nprohibit or at least monitor for the execution of previously unseen executables from\nnon-standard or non-update sources. Again, while imperfect given how some\nlegitimate software packages are created and distributed, this may nonetheless serve\nat least as an initial alarm to prompt further investigation and possibly limit the spread\nof malicious software in sensitive networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin the context of ICS historian operations specifically, organizations can\npotentially identify a disruptive attack in progress by implementing logic or monitoring\non their historian (such as GE Proficy in this case) to identify cases where multiple\nendpoints cease communication and reporting to the historian at approximately the\nsame time. While systems may still be offline or compromised, identifying this\ndatapoint early in the investigation will facilitate root cause analysis into the event by\nidentifying potential ICS-specific functionality, such as that displayed in EKANS.\nAlthough a frequent recommendation for ransomware events, organizations must\nplace emphasis on generating regular backups of important files and systems and\nstoring them in a secure location not easily accessible from the regular network. For\nICS operations in particular, backups must include last known-good configuration\ndata, project files, and related items to enable rapid recovery should a disruptive event\noccur.\n\n## Network\n\nWhere possible, identify the transfer of unknown binary files via network means from\nenterprise networks to control system enclaves. While imperfect, identifying when\nexecutable code enters the ICS environment can at least allow defenders to correlate\nthis activity with other suspicious observations (such as new logon or promiscuous\nlogon activity) that may indicate an intrusion is underway.\nDragos’ Professional Services team has worked with companies disrupted by\nransomware attacks. The following are some key lessons learned from responding to\nransomware incidents at industrial companies.\n\n**Beware your backups**\n\nMany ransomware attacks also impact backup infrastructure. In a recent ransomware\nincident Dragos responded to, attackers encrypted the Synology network attached\nstorage (NAS) that was mounted as a Sever Message Block (SMB) share to all\nsystems to store backups. Luckily, an engineer had previously decided to take a copy\nof the backups on an external drive. Unfortunately, the backups were about 18\nmonths old, so the victim lost a lot of production data, and the engineering\nenhancements and logic changes made during that time. In addition to maintaining\noffline backups, backup procedures should consider not only systems, but critical\ndata. While backing up a system may be fine every three months for example, critical\ndata required for business operations may need to be available down to the day or\nhour. Companies should ensure this information is identified and categorized based\non criticality and available if all systems are encrypted. Additionally, Dragos\nrecommended that logic is backed up after any significant changes.\n\n**Don’t neglect the control layer**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen performing recovery efforts on a plant network, primary focus may be on\nrestoring supervisory control, like impacted Windows assets. However, it may be\npossible for attackers to use ransomware to cover secondary process impacts or\ncover up an attacker’s true intent. In recent Dragos investigations, we have found\nevidence of attackers probing automation controllers, likely network enumeration and\nscanning, however this is difficult to verify. In this case, the only controller logic\navailable dated back just 18 months, so performing logic verification identified a lot of\nunexpected changes and it was unclear whether attackers or operators who forgot to\ndocument changes were responsible. Dragos recommends operators ensure\ncontroller logic is backed up frequently and procedures are available to verify logic\nafter an incident. Additionally, asset owners and operators may want to investigate\nwith vendors to identify the type of security logs available on the controllers.\n\n**Time is of the essence**\n\nAdversaries responsible for ransomware incidents act quickly. In many cases,\nadversaries are not interested in the underlying infrastructure or data, they just want to\nencrypt the systems as quickly as possible. In the customer ransomware incident\nmentioned above, responders observed a turnaround of less than 24 hours between\ninitial access, obtaining domain admin, and plant-wide ransomware deployment.\nAttackers in this event dropped more than 30 tools on the end points and brute forced\nauthentication credentials. Proper monitoring and response procedures could detect\nthem and block the attack; however, responders need to act quickly.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nEKANS ransomware is unique as it joins a handful of ICS-specific malware variants, such\nas Havex and CRASHOVERRIDE, in having specific references to industrial processes. At\nthe same time, EKANS actual implementation of such functionality is extremely primitive\nwith an indeterminate industrial impact.\n\n**_EKANS malware and its attempt to cease particular industrial-related processes is_**\n**_further evolution and context around the growing cyber threat to industrial control_**\n**_systems, but EKANS itself is more a novelty than a discrete and worrying risk._**\n\nNonetheless, EKANS (and its likely predecessor MEGACORTEX) represent an adversary\nevolution to hold control system environments specifically at risk. As such, EKANS despite\nits limited functionality and nature represents a relatively new and deeply concerning\nevolution in ICS-targeting malware. Whereas previously ICS-specific or ICS-related\nmalware was solely the playground of state-sponsored entities, EKANS appears to indicate\nnon-state elements pursuing financial gain are now involved in this space as well, even if\nonly at a very primitive level. As a result, it is incumbent upon ICS asset owners and\n\n\n-----\n\noperators to learn from not only how EKANS itself functions, but the myriad ways in which\nmalicious software like EKANS can propagate and be distributed in control system\nenvironments to prepare actionable, relevant defense.\n\n## Appendix A – EKANS Targeted Processes\n\n**Process** **Description**\n\nbluestripecollector.exe BlueStripe Data Collector\n\nccflic0.exe Proficy Licensing\n\nccflic4.exe Proficy Licensing\n\ncdm.exe Nimsoft Related\n\ncertificateprovider.exe Ambiguous\n\nclient.exe Ambiguous\n\nclient64.exe Ambiguous\n\ncollwrap.exe BlueStripe Data Collector\n\nconfig_api_service.exe ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity Suite, Ambiguous\n\ndsmcsvc.exe Tivoli Storage Manager Client\n\nepmd.exe RabbitMQ Server (SolarWinds)\n\nerlsrv.exe Erlang\n\nfnplicensingservice.exe FLEXNet Licensing Service\n\nhasplmv.exe Sentinel Hasp License Manager\n\nhdb.exe Honeywell HMIWeb\n\nhealthservice.exe Microsoft SCCM\n\nilicensevc.exe GE Fanuc Licenseing\n\ninet_gethost.exe Erlang\n\nkeysvc.exe Ambiguous\n\nmanagementagenthost.exe VMWare CAF Management Agent Service\n\nmonitoringhost.exe Microsoft SCCM\n\nmsdtssrvr.exe Microsoft SQL Server Integration Service\n\n\n-----\n\nmsmdsrv.exe Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services\n\nmustnotificationux.exe Microsoft Update Notification Service\n\nn.exe Ambiguous\n\nnimbus.exe Broadcom Nimbus\n\nnpmdagent.exe Microsoft OMS Agent\n\nntevl.exe Nimsoft Monitor\n\nntservices.exe 360 Total Security\n\npralarmmgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprcalculationmgr.exe Proficy Historian Data Calculation Service\n\nprconfigmgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprdatabasemgr.exe Proficy Related\n\npremailengine.exe Proficy Related\n\npreventmgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprftpengine.exe Proficy Related\n\nprgateway.exe Proficy Secure Gateway\n\nprlicensingmgr.exe Proficy License Server Manager\n\nproficyadministrator.exe Proficy Related\n\nproficyclient.exe Proficy Related\n\nproficypublisherservice.exe Proficy Related\n\nproficyserver.exe Proficy Server\n\nproficysts.exe Proficy Related\n\nprprintserver.exe Proficy Related\n\nprproficymgr.exe Proficy Plant Applications\n\nprrds.exe Proficy Remote Data Service\n\nprreader.exe Proficy Historian Data Calculation Service\n\nprrouter.exe Proficy Related\n\n\n-----\n\nprschedulemgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprstubber.exe Proficy Related\n\nprsummarymgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprwriter.exe Proficy Historian Data Calculation Service\n\nreportingservicesservice.exe Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service\n\nserver_eventlog.exe Proficy Event Log Service, Ambiguous\n\nserver_runtime.exe Proficy Related, Ambiguous\n\nspooler.exe Ambiguous\n\nsqlservr.exe Microsoft SQL Server\n\ntaskhostw.exe Windows OS\n\nvgauthservice.exe VMWare Guest Authentication Service\n\nvmacthlp.exe VMWare Activation Helper\n\nvmtoolsd.exe VMWare Tools Service\n\nwin32sysinfo.exe RabbitMQ\n\nwinvnc4.exe WinVNC Client\n\nworkflowresttest.exe Ambiguous\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1] [Vitali Kremez;](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1214333066245812224?s=20) [SNAKE Ransomware is the Next Threat Targeting Business Networks –](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snake-ransomware-is-the-next-threat-targeting-business-networks/)\nBleepingComputer; Dragos WorldView customers should consult TR-2020-02 EKANS\nRansomware and ICS Operations\n\n[2] [Ransomware Linked to Iran, Targets Industrial Controls – Bloomberg;](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/-snake-ransomware-linked-to-iran-targets-industrial-controls) Snake: IndustrialFocused Ransomware with Ties to Iran – Otorio\n\n_[[3] The Epic Turla (snake/Uroburos) Attacks – Kaspersky; Turla – MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/)_\n\n[[4] Implications of IT Ransomware for ICS Environments – Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/implications-of-it-ransomware-for-ics-environments/)\n\n[5] [Out of Control: Ransomware for Industrial Control Systems – David Formby, Srikar](http://www.cap.gatech.edu/)\nDurbha, and Raheem Beyah; ClearEnergy – The “In the Wild” SCADA Ransomware\nAttacks that Never Existed – BleepingComputer\n\n[6] [Open Mal Analysis Notes – Sysopfb (GitHub)](https://github.com/sysopfb/open_mal_analysis_notes/blob/master/e5262db186c97bbe533f0a674b08ecdafa3798ea7bc17c705df526419c168b60.md)\n\n\n-----\n\n[7] [Proficy Historian – GE](https://www.ge.com/digital/applications/proficy-historian)\n\n[8] [HMIWeb Solutions – Honeywell; Fanuc](https://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/support/_layouts/honeywell/hps/support-product.aspx?column=Releases&PN=HMIWeb%20Solutions)\n\n[9] [ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity Product Brief – PTC;](https://www.ptc.com/en/resources/iiot/product-brief/thingworx-industrial-connectivity) [FlexNet Licensing – Flexera;](https://www.flexera.com/products/flexnet-manager.html)\n[Sentinel HASP – Gemalto](https://sentinel.gemalto.com/software-monetization/all-products/sentinel-hasp)\n\n[10] [Ransomware or Wiper?
