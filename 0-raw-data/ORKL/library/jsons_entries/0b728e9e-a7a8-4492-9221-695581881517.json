The new technique dubbed \"IPfuscation\" was identified by](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-uses-new-ipfuscation-trick-to-hide-payload/)\nSentinel Labs researchers who examined various 64-bit Windows executables, all of which\n[had Cobalt Strike-delivering payloads. Hive has obfuscated the payload by impersonating](https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/malware/linux-based-cobalt-strike-tool-takes-advantage-of-threat-detection-difficulties)\nASCII IPv4 addresses but converting the file from string to binary prompts the appearance of\nshellcode. Researchers found that upon completion, the shellcode will be executed by the\nmalware through direct SYSCALLs or proxy execution. More IPfuscation variants have been\nobserved by researchers, with IPv6, MAC, and UUID addresses also being leveraged by the\nransomware group. The findings suggest that static signature dependence alone is\ninadequate in detecting malicious payloads. Organizations should also deploy behavioral\ndetection, artificial intelligence-based analysis, and holistic security approaches for their\nendpoints to better detect IPfuscation techniques, according to researchers.\n\n[SC Staff](https://www.scmagazine.com/author/sc-staff)\n\n## Related\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.scmagazine.com/topic/ransomware)\nGoodWill ransomware stipulates acts of kindness\n\n[SC StaffMay 27, 2022](https://www.scmagazine.com/author/sc-staff)\n\nOrganizations impacted by the GoodWill ransomware gang are being ordered by attackers to\ncarry out good deeds before being able to download a tool for file decryption.\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.scmagazine.com/topic/ransomware)\nIndustrial Spy ventures into ransomware\n\n[SC StaffMay 27, 2022](https://www.scmagazine.com/author/sc-staff)\n\nNewly-discovered data extortion marketplace Industrial Spy has entered the ransomware\ngame, with MalwareHunterTeam discovering a new Industrial Spy malware sample\ncontaining a ransom note.\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.scmagazine.com/topic/ransomware)\n[VMware ESXi servers under attack from novel Cheers ransomware](https://www.scmagazine.com/brief/ransomware/vmware-esxi-servers-under-attack-from-novel-cheers-ransomware)\n\n[SC StaffMay 26, 2022](https://www.scmagazine.com/author/sc-staff)\n\n\n-----\n\nVulnerable VMware ESXi servers are being impacted by the new Cheers, or Cheerscrypt,\nransomware strain.\n\n\n-----",
