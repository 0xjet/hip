But these systems are vulnerable: by attacking positioning, navigational, and\ntiming (PNT) data through electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, state and non-state actors can\ncause significant damage to modern militaries, major economies, and everyday consumers\nalike.[1] [2] [3] With recent technological advances, the tools and methodologies for conducting this\ninterference are now at a high risk for proliferation. GNSS attacks are emerging as a viable,\n**_disruptive strategic threat._**\n\nIn this report, we present findings from a year-long investigation ending in November 2018 on\nan emerging subset of EW activity: the ability to mimic, or “spoof,” legitimate GNSS signals in\norder to manipulate PNT data. Using publicly available data and commercial technologies, we\ndetect and analyze patterns of GNSS spoofing in the Russian Federation, Crimea, and Syria that\ndemonstrate the Russian Federation is growing a comparative advantage in the targeted use\nand development of GNSS spoofing capabilities to achieve tactical and strategic objectives at\nhome and abroad. We profile different use cases of current Russian state activity to trace the\nactivity back to basing locations and systems in use.\n\n  - In Section One, we examine GNSS spoofing events across the entire Russian Federation,\nits occupied territories, and overseas military facilities. We identify 9,883 suspected\ninstances across 10 locations that affected 1,311 civilian vessel navigation systems since\nFebruary 2016. We demonstrate that these activities are much larger in scope, more\ndiverse in geography, and longer in duration than any public reporting suggests to date.\n\n  - In **Section Two, we examine the role of Russian GNSS spoofing for very important**\nperson (VIP) protection. We find a close correlation between movements of the Russian\nhead of state and GNSS spoofing events. We believe the Russian Federal Protective\nService (FSO) operates mobile systems to support this activity. Through a review of\nRussian procurement data, we identify one possible mobile system, manufactured by a\ncompany closely connected to the FSO.\n\n  - In **Section Three, we profile the use of Russian GNSS spoofing for strategic facilities**\nprotection. We identify potential technology in use for facility protection in Moscow. We\nalso highlight spoofing activities taking place in proximity to protected facilities on the\ncoast of Russia and Crimea in the Black Sea. Through a line of sight analysis, we judge\nthe most likely placement for a GNSS spoofing transmitter on the Black Sea to be at a\nmulti-million dollar “palace,” formerly owned by reported family members of senior FSO\nofficers and previously reported to be built for President Putin.\n\n  - Finally, in Section Four, we expose the use of GPS spoofing in active Russian combat\nzones, particularly Syria, for airspace denial purposes. This is a capability scarcely\nreported in the public domain. Using data from a scientific sensor on the International\nSpace Station (ISS), we are able to identify ongoing activity that poses significant threats\nto civilian airline GPS systems in the region. We pinpoint the most likely location for\nthe system to the northwestern quadrant of Khmeimim airbase, and identify potential\nmilitary-grade EW systems in use through publicly available information.\n\nThe Russian Federation has a comparative advantage in the targeted use and development\nof GNSS spoofing capabilities. However, the low cost, commercial availability, and ease of\ndeployment of these technologies will empower not only states, but also insurgents, terrorists,\nand criminals in a wide range of destabilizing state-sponsored and non-state illicit networks.\nGNSS spoofing activities endanger everything from global navigational safety to civilian finance,\nlogistics, and communication systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������3\n\n METHODOLOGY\b������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������5\n\nVessel Detection Methodology\b���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������5\n\nTransmitter Localization from Low-Earth Orbit Methodology\b����������������������������8\n\n#### GNSS SPOOFING: OVERVIEW AND APPLICATIONS\b��������������������������������������������������������10\n\n SPOOFING ACTIVITY ACROSS RUSSIA, CRIMEA, AND SYRIA\b������������������������������������15\n\nTimeline of Detected Activity\b�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������17\n\nGeography of Detected Activity\b���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������20\n\nScope of Detected Activity\b����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������20\n\nTrend I: GNSS Receivers are Spoofed to Multiple Locations\b�������������������������������������21\n\nTrend II: Activity Takes Place Near Sensitive Government Airspace\b�������������������23\n\nTrend III: Activity is Indiscriminate to Ownership and International\nBoundaries\b������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������24\n\n#### PROTECTING VIPS \b����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������26\n\nThe Kerch Bridge Visit \b����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������26\n\nThe Zvezda Shipyard Visit\b����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������28\n\n#### DEFENDING STRATEGIC FACILITIES ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������31\n\nOfficial Russian Government Facilities\b��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������31\n\nUnofficial Government Facilities\b���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������37\n\n#### MILITARY PROTECTION ABROAD\b��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������44\n\nFrom Jamming to Spoofing in Syria \b���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������44\n\n#### CONCLUSION\b����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������51\n\n ENDNOTES\b��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������52\n\n\n-----\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis report presents findings from a year-long investigation ending in November 2018\non Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing activities affecting civilian GNSS\nreceivers in the Russian Federation, its occupied territories, and the Syrian Arab Republic.\nThrough our reporting we seek to illustrate the effectiveness of using publicly available\ndata and technologies to report on GNSS interference activities. The report presents\ncase studies on three unique applications of GNSS spoofing, highlighting Russia’s role\nin pioneering the use of these capabilities to protect and promote its strategic interests.\nIn each case study, we relied on publicly available information such as: GNSS positioning\ndata, official records, news and social media reporting, and satellite imagery. Following\nan examination of publicly available data, we collaborated with The University of Texas\nat Austin (UT). Using signal recordings from a GPS receiver based on the International\nSpace Station (ISS) in low-Earth-orbit (LEO), we characterized, mapped, and identified\npotential basing locations and equipment involved in GNSS spoofing activities in Syria.\nWe then examine the broader ramifications of these findings.\n\nAny mention of GNSS refers to space-based navigation systems such as the US Global\nPositioning System (GPS/NAVSTAR), Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System\n(GLONASS), the European Union’s Galileo System, China’s Beidou Navigation Satellite\nSystem, India’s Navigation Indian Constellation (NavIC), and Japan’s Quazi-Zenith\nSatellite System (QZSS). Unless explicitly stated, the specific navigation systems targeted\nby the GNSS spoofing activities detailed in this report have not been confirmed. This\nreport’s investigations only detail activities that have affected civilian GNSS receivers.\nCivilian systems are more vulnerable to interference activities like GNSS jamming and\nspoofing than encrypted military GNSS receivers.\n\nC4ADS used two distinct investigative methods to identify and map GNSS spoofing\nactivities in Russia and Syria: (1) spoofing detection through marine vessel Automatic\nIdentification System (AIS) path histories and (2) spoofing detection through a LEO\nsatellite GNSS receiver. Each method presents ways in which publicly and commercially\navailable data can be used to identify potential basing locations for devices used to\nconduct denial-of-service GNSS spoofing activities. The methodologies detailed in this\nreport are highly replicable and scalable, and can be applied to other sources of GNSS\npositioning data, such as fitness tracking applications and aircraft positioning signals.\n\n**_Vessel Detection Methodology_**\n\nIn order to find instances of denial-of-service GNSS spoofing affecting maritime\nnavigation systems off the coast of the Russian Federation and Crimea, C4ADS, using\ntechnology from a maritime risk analytics company, used GNSS positioning information\nderived from maritime vessel AIS data consistent with known behaviors exhibited\nby victim receivers. In this case, C4ADS identified vessels that reported positioning\ninformation at civilian airports, mirroring public reports of GNSS spoofing in Russia.\nC4ADS manually verified and cross-referenced these path histories with thise of other\nvessels exhibiting similar patterns of behavior in order to help confirm that suspected\nvictim vessel path histories are not the result of malfunctioning AIS equipment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, using Palantir Foundry, C4ADS conducted both trends analysis and targeted\ninvestigations to identify where and when vessels fell victim to spoofing events.\n\nAfter C4ADS identified vessels affected by GNSS spoofing activities, we conducted\ninvestigations to determine actors present at each location at the time of the events.\nC4ADS collected information from records and reporting in English, Russian, and\nUkrainian. Using line of sight analyses derived from the location information of ships\naffected by the spoofing activity, we identified potential land-based GNSS spoofing\ntransmitter positions. We conducted further research on locations identified through\nthis analysis using official property ownership and transfer records, official corporate\nrecords, and news and social media posts. Finally, we combined the above analysis\nwith information contained in notice to airmen (NOTAM) alerts and satellite imagery to\nidentify potential systems and motivations for this activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Transmitter Localization from Low-Earth Orbit Methodology_**\n\nC4ADS, through close partnership with and technical expertise from researchers from\nUT Austin, collected, analyzed, and geolocated denial-of-service spoofing signals using\na GPS receiver In low-Earth orbit (LEO) aboard the ISS.[4] In total, we collected three\nrecordings on frequencies used by the GPS L1 and L2 frequency bands on three days\nin the spring of 2018. Researchers at UT Austin analyzed the raw signal data and used\nDoppler-based geolocation, illustrated below, to identify the origin point of the GPS\nspoofing transmissions.\n\nOnce UT Austin researchers analyzed and geolocated the interference signals, C4ADS\nused publicly available satellite imagery, official records, and imagery posted on social\nmedia to identify potential electronic warfare (EW) assets in use at the source location\nand their intended effects on target receivers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report is not designed to be an analysis of any country’s laws or regulations,\nnor does it make conclusions about the intent or legality behind the GNSS spoofing\nactivities detailed herein. We seek instead to profile and expose a critical issue of public\ninterest. **The mention of any individual, company, organization, or other entity in**\n**this report does not imply the violation of any law or international agreement, and**\n**should not be construed as such.**\n\n\n**_Technical Definitions_**\n\nThis report does not cover all existing forms of GNSS interference and thus, it relies on\nthe following definitions to delineate between different variants of interference:\n\n  - **GNSS Jamming, also referred to as brute force jamming, is when an attacker**\ngenerates noise-like signals at frequencies used by a GNSS system in order to\nprevent GNSS receivers from tracking authentic signals.[5] [6]\n\n  - **Denial-of-Service GNSS Spoofing, sometimes referred to as ‘smart-jamming,’ is**\nwhen an attacker mimics authentic GNSS signals in order to hijack target GNSS\nreceiver tracking loops and feed false or even blank navigational information to\nthe vulnerable receiver. [7] In most cases, the effects of denial-of-service spoofing\nare readily apparent to the user. Unless explicitly stated, references to ‘GNSS\n**_spoofing’ in this report will refer only to denial-of-service spoofing attacks._**\n\n  - **Deception GNSS Spoofing is when an attacker mimics authentic GNSS signals**\nin order to hijack target GNSS receiver tracking loops, feed false positioning or\ntiming information to the target receiver, and covertly misdirect the receiver\nand its platform to some desired location. Successful attacks will deceive both\nthe target receiver and its user.[8]\n\nAmong GNSS interference experts, there are competing definitions on when spoofing\ncan be categorized as either deception or denial-of-service.[9] For the purpose of this\npaper we use the above definitions. However, for more information about alternate\ndefinitions, see \"Unmanned Aircraft Capture and Control via GPS Spoofing” by Kerns,\nShepard, Bhatti, and Humphreys.\n\n\n-----\n\n## GNSS Spoofing: Overview and Applications\n\nIn the summer of 2013, a research team\nfrom The University of Texas at Austin (UT)\nsuccessfully hijacked the GPS navigation\nsystems onboard an $80 million\nsuperyacht using a $2,000 device the\nsize of a small briefcase. The experimental\nattack forced the ship’s navigation systems\nto relay false positioning information to\nthe vessel’s captain, who subsequently\nmade slight course corrections to keep\nthe ship seemingly on track. In reality, the\nfalsified signals generated by UT Austin’s device had successfully set the vessel offcourse by several degrees, all without tripping a single alarm on the ship’s navigational\nalert systems. While this was a controlled experiment, a malicious actor could use the\nsame techniques to direct a vessel to stray into hostile waters.\n\nThe 2013 experiment demonstrated the use of one of the world’s first openly\nacknowledged GNSS spoofing devices.[10] At its core, GNSS spoofing is the deliberate\ntransmission of signals designed to emulate the authentic satellite systems that\nunderpin much of the world’s critical infrastructure. GNSS spoofing is distinct from\nother forms of navigation interference such as GNSS jamming, which simply drowns\nout satellite signals to prevent receivers from using them.[i] Instead, spoofed signals are\nable to force vulnerable GNSS receivers, like those installed on the superyacht, to lose\ntheir lock on authentic satellite signals and instead lock on to the signals generated\nby the spoofing device.[ii] Once a receiver locks on to the spoofed signals, the spoofing\ntransmitter can relay false position or timing information to the victim receiver, thereby\n“taking control.”[iii] UT Austin’s successful experiment served to expose just one of the\nmany systems vulnerable to GNSS spoofing attacks.\n\ni GNSS Jamming is the deliberate transmission of signals on frequencies used by GNSS in an effort to prevent\nreceivers from locking-on to authentic GNSS Signals. GNSS jamming requires relatively little technical knowledge and\ncan be conducted by simply drowning out authentic signals with random or disruptive noise. For more information,\nsee https://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/\n\nGNSS jamming is the deliberate transmission of signals on frequencies used by GNSS in an effort to prevent receivers\nfrom locking-on to authentic GNSS Signals. GNSS jamming requires relatively little technical knowledge and can be\nconducted by simply drowning out authentic signals with random or disruptive noise. For more information, see\nhttps://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/\nii As previously mentioned, Denial-of-Service GNSS Spoofing, sometimes referred to as ‘smart-jamming’, is\nwhen an attacker mimics authentic GNSS signals in order to hijack target GNSS receiver tracking loops and feed\nfalse or even blank navigational information to the vulnerable receiver. In most cases, the effects of denial-ofservice spoofing are readily apparent to the user. Deception GNSS Spoofing, on the other hand, is when an attacker\nmimics authentic GNSS signals in order to hijack target GNSS receiver tracking loops (through capture and drag-off\ntechniques), feed false positioning or timing information to the target receiver, and covertly misdirect the receiver\nand its platform to some desired location. Successful attacks will deceive both the target receiver and its user. For\nmore information, see http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/space/au-18-2009/au-18_chap21.pdf and http://rnl.ae.utexas.edu/\nimages/stories/files/papers/gnss_spoofing_detection.pdf\niii In most public examples GNSS spoofing, the spoofing transmitter simulates false GNSS satellite ephemeris\nand timing information which coerces the victim receiver to calculate incorrect positioning and, in some cases,\ntiming information.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe proven effectiveness of GNSS spoofing attacks on critical systems like maritime\nnavigation equipment is increasingly recognized by US and other governments. A 2012\nNational Risk Estimate conducted by the US Department of Homeland Security found\nthat “US critical infrastructure sectors are increasingly at risk from a growing dependency\non the Global Positioning System (GPS) for space-based position, navigation, and\ntiming (PNT).”[11] The report concluded that GNSS spoofing attack scenarios in particular\npresented the highest consequences to critical national infrastructure due to the\npotential lapse of time between when the interference begins and when it is detected.[12]\nA similar report commissioned by the United Kingdom Space Agency in 2017 asserted\nthat “all critical national infrastructure” in the UK relies on GNSS to some extent, and\nthat a five-day disruption to GNSS would result in an estimated £5.2 billion in economic\nloss.[13]\n\nGNSS is embedded in a wide range of basic day-to-day economic and transport\nfunctions, but many civilian systems remain vulnerable. Attackers could use multiple\ntechniques to disrupt and even profit off of these potential vulnerabilities, as summarized\nin the table below:\n\n|Sector|Systems Using GNSS|GNSS Spoofing Scenario|\n|---|---|---|\n|Transportation|• Maritime navigation systems • Road navigation / Advanced Driver Advisory Systems • Air transport infrastructure / Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast • Logistics monitoring and management • Automated navigation systems • Port container management systems • Vehicle-to-vehicle communications for connected and automated vehicle coordination|• Divert vessel into hostile or territorial waters • Disrupt port activities by targeting cranes using GNSS for automated container logistics • Hijack cargo in transit by disguising true location of container • Deny aircraft use of satellite navigation systems|\n|Communication|• Cellular communication networks • Fixed-line communication networks|• Target time synchronization systems on cellular network systems to degrade and disrupt operations|\n|Law Enforcement|• Search and rescue systems • GNSS positioning information as evidentiary material • Asset monitoring and tracking • Law enforcement equipment with time-based software licenses|• A vessel turning off its AIS transponder can alert regulators to possible illicit activity, spoofing location through vessel GNSS receiver can conceal vessels engaging in illicit trade, fishing, or sanctions evasion • Degrade the reliability of using GPS telemetry for legal action and proceedings • Force law enforcement equipment user licenses using GNSS for timing to prematurely expire|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Sector|Systems Using GNSS|GNSS Spoofing Scenario|\n|---|---|---|\n|Defense|• Air-gapped NTP servers using GNSS for time synchronization • Precision Guided Munitions • Military GNSS receivers that have not been rekeyed with current encryption key. • Small unmanned aerial vehicles without spoofing countermeasure systems installed|• Spoof military GNSS receivers that have not been rekeyed due to human error. • Spoof GNSS timing signals on an air gapped NTP server to ‘turn back time’ on a time-based one-time password system • Target small military or monitoring drones to deny reconnaissance missions over sensitive locations|\n|Financial|• Stock Exchange • Insurance telematics|• Target time synchronization systems for unsecured stock exchanges to drag off time and create artificial systems of arbitrage • Abuse marine delay in start up insurance on high value shipments to profit on insurance claims|\n|Energy|• Power substation load transfer systems|• Degrade GPS-dependent time synchronization systems at power substations to cause widespread outage|\n\n\nDespite these vulnerabilities, leaders in the public and private sectors have paid little\nattention to the threat of GNSS spoofing. Until recently, this was for good reason.\nSignal generators capable of conducting a spoofing attack cost of tens of thousands\nof dollars and required expert knowledge to operate. But this all began to change\nover the past decade with the advent of cheap, commercially available, and portable\n“software defined radios” (SDR) and open-source code capable of transmitting spoofed\nGPS signals. SDRs are used for a variety of innocuous applications including amateur\nradio broadcast, aircraft tracking, and ship tracking. Today, these devices are capable\nof mimicking authentic, multimillion-dollar GPS satellite signals and can be produced\nfor under $300—less than the price of a new television.[iv] Inexpensive systems have\nalready been used to hijack vehicle navigation systems,[14] cheat at Pokémon GO,[15] and\neven “turn back time” on time-based authentication systems.[16] According to some US\ngovernment officials, even drug cartels are beginning to use GNSS spoofing to mask\ntheir activities and target smaller US drones.[17]\n\nThe Russian Federation is a pioneer in the use of these techniques to further its strategic\ninterests at home and abroad. In response to NATO’s advantage in C4ISR[v] capabilities,\nRussia has prioritized the development of a comprehensive suite of asymmetrical EW\nsystems designed to deceive, degrade, and deny military and civilian GNSS receivers.[18]\n\n19 In effect, Russian forces now have the capability to create large GNSS denial-ofservice spoofing environments, all without directly targeting a single GNSS satellite.\nThese systems are widely believed to be in use across Russia’s Western and Southern\nMilitary Districts at the border with NATO and reportedly have been forward deployed\nin conflict zones such as Ukraine[20] and Syria.[21]\n\niv The author was able to purchase all components for a homemade GPS spoofing device for less than $350.\nv Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) is a\ngeneral term that refers to the systems and techniques used to collect and process information.\n\n\n-----\n\nIncreasing use of GNSS spoofing capabilities among the Russian military and security\nservices has caused spillover effects on civilian systems. Public reports from Moscow\nbegan to surface in June 2016 claiming that mobile phone navigation systems often\nreported false positioning information when in proximity to the Kremlin.[22] [23] After\nsimilar activity was detected in Saint Petersburg, many were quick to hypothesize that\nthis interference was tied to counter-drone activities of the Russian Federal Protective\nService (FSO), the government entity charged with protecting Russia’s president.[24] [25]\nThese hypotheses, however, remained unconfirmed. In June 2017, the captain of the\nmerchant vessel Atria provided direct evidence of GNSS spoofing activities off the\ncoast of Gelendzhik, Russia, when the vessel’s on-board navigation systems indicated\nit was located in the middle of the Gelendzhik Airport, about 20km away.[26] More than\ntwo dozen other vessels reported similar disruptions in the region on that day.[27] The US\nMaritime Administration subsequently issued a GPS interference advisory for vessels\nin the Black Sea, one of the first of its kind.[28] Activity was reported on a larger scale\nduring military exercises, including Russia’s Zapad 2017 and NATO’s Trident Juncture\n2018, when Norway and Finland reported severe GPS outages affecting commercial\nairliners and cell phone networks for several days.[29] [30]\n\nTo date, methods for detecting GNSS spoofing and other interference have been\nreserved for organizations with the ability to leverage advanced means for signals\ncollection. As a result, the full scope of this activity has rarely been discussed in the\npublic domain. With the democratization of technological capabilities and access to\ndata, these advanced means are now available to a wider audience. This report serves\n**as one of the first systems-level demonstrations of how publicly available data can**\n**be used to identify, detect, and expose the deployment of denial-of-service GNSS**\n**spoofing capabilities. In doing so, we demonstrate how the use of GNSS spoofing in**\nthe Russian Federation, its occupied territories, and its overseas military facilities is far\nmore pervasive and advanced than previously thought.\n\n\n-----\n\n### SPOOFING ACTIVITY ACROSS RUSSIA, CRIMEA, AND SYRIA\n\n**C4ADS found that GNSS spoofing activities in the Russian Federation, its occupied**\n**territories, and its overseas military facilities are larger in scope, more geographically**\n**diverse, and started earlier than any public reporting has suggested to date. Reports**\nby CNN[31] and the RNT Foundation[32] identify fewer than 450 vessels affected since late\n2016.[i] Using Automatic Identification System (AIS) ship location data collected at scale,\nC4ADS identified 9,883 instances[ii] of GNSS spoofing that affected 1,311 commercial\nvessels beginning in February 2016.[iii] The disruptions appear to have originated from\nten or more locations in Russia and Russian-controlled areas in Crimea and Syria.\n\nC4ADS needed a proxy that would display patterns of disruption associated with\nspoofing. In principle, any device that relies on GNSS could be used to detect spoofing\nactivity. In Moscow, for example, where GNSS spoofing disruptions have been observed\nnear the Kremlin, public reporting has shown that location-based apps such as Uber\noften report false positioning data, mistakenly calculating fares for locations thousands\nof miles away.[33] It is also possible to detect this activity through other devices that\nreport GNSS positioning information.\n\nPublicly available position heatmaps derived from fitness tracker applications, such as\nStrava, can also be used to identify GNSS receiver path histories that exhibit unusual\npatterns.[34] Data from Strava shows a pattern of individuals in central Moscow suddenly\n\ni Estimates of the number of victim vessels ranged from a few dozen to about 450. The first significant\nreporting of GPS spoofing in Moscow surfaced around October 2016.\nii C4ADS defined a spoofing ‘instance’ as every time we detected a vessel reporting a false position information\nat a civilian airport.\niii C4ADS examined AIS data between January 2013 and November 2018, but only detected spoofing activity\nbeginning in February 2016. Activities may have taken place prior to this time frame, but could not be included in our\nsample set.\n\n\n-----\n\nappearing at the Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo airport runways in Moscow. At normal\nairports throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, device position paths typically\nremain confined to aircraft taxiing paths and the terminal area, as seen below in the\nheatmap of Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, where activity is relatively normal. In\ncontrast, victim receivers potentially located in central Moscow appear to be spoofed to\ndiscrete coordinates, which appear as hot spots on the Vnukovo Airport tarmac, about\n20km outside Moscow. With the working assumption that the airport authorities do\nnot allow passengers to run in circles on an active runway, these positions are highly\nsuspect.\n\nWhile Strava shows patterns of GNSS spoofing, AIS data present a more extensive,\nreliable, and easily studied source of location data. We found that AIS data served as a\ngood proxy for identifying GNSS spoofing activity. GNSS spoofing activities that force\nmaritime vessels to report positioning information at nearby airports create an easily\nrecognizable and detectable pattern of activity where vessels that are clearly at sea\nreport their positions on land. By building datasets of all vessels that exhibited these\ncharacteristics, C4ADS identified a number of additional vessels affected by GNSS\nspoofing activities in the waters around the Russian Federation.\n\nWe found that across all instances of GNSS spoofing detected in Russia and Crimea,\nreceivers reported false positioning information at a local civilian airport, often dozens\nof kilometers away. Our findings support previous public reports that the GNSS\nspoofing activities detected in Russia are designed as a denial-of-service tool to activate\nfirmware-level geofence locks on commercial drones. These locks prevent drones from\nflying in restricted airspace, such as the areas over airports.[35] If a commercial drone\nlocks on to the spoofed signals, they would either return to what they perceive as ‘nonrestricted’ airspace or land immediately.[36] Such a capability would have a wide range of\nboth offensive and defensive applications but is likely to be relatively indiscriminate in\nnature, affecting both intended and unintended receivers in the vicinity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Timeline of Detected Activity_**\n\nGNSS spoofing in Russia and Crimea began long before public reporting on these\ndisruptions emerged. This activity can be detected off the coast of Gelendzhik in early\nFebruary 2016, more than a year before the June 2017 US Maritime Administration alert\non Black Sea activity.[37]\n\nIn the timeline of spoofing events above, created from analysis in Palantir Foundry, we\ncan view several key trends in how these disruptions evolved between February 2016\nand November 2018. When the activity first began in the spring of 2016, fewer than a\ndozen vessels were affected. However, over the next year, these events increased rapidly\nin both frequency and scope, possibly as these spoofing transmitters proliferated to\nnew locations and increased in strength. Following high-profile public exposure of\n\n\n-----\n\nthese events in several Russian and Western news outlets in June and July 2017, the\nfrequency of these events appeared to gradually decrease.[38] [39]\n\nThrough investigations into events at each location, we found that GNSS spoofing likely\nbegan in 2016 in at least eight of the nine locations in Russia and Crimea where we\nfound evidence of spoofing. Spoofing events near Gelendzhik, Sochi, Saint Petersburg,\nand Olyva were among the most frequent in the data analyzed; activity was detected\non 462 separate days between February 2016 and November 2018. Activity at these\nlocations took place on 46 percent of all days examined. In almost all cases where brief\nGNSS spoofing events occurred in remote locations in Russia and Crimea, such as in\nArkhangelsk, Vladivostok, and Kerch, we found that spoofing events directly coincided\nwith visits by Russian president Vladimir Putin. In the case studies examined later in\nthis report, we hypothesize that the short-lived and isolated nature of these one-off\nevents suggests that at least some devices used to conduct this activity are mobile\nand can be temporarily deployed at a location to create local areas of effect.\n\nC4ADS also found evidence suggesting that multiple GNSS spoofing devices were in\nuse. Spoofed GNSS signals can generally only affect receivers that are within line of\nsight of the spoofing device.[40] Therefore, the range of these devices is typically limited\nto the surrounding area. In our sample, there were 593 instances where vessels located\nin areas too far for a single land-based transmitter to reach were affected within the\nsame hour. Additionally, it appears that the spoofing devices may not be constantly\nactive as vessels’ locations were not consistently spoofed. In the timeline and frequency\ndistribution graphs pictured above and the example shown below, spoofing activity\nappears to ‘swap’ between two or more locations over time. When spoofing activity at\none location ends, it often resumes at a separate location shortly after, indicating that\nthis activity is coordinated to some degree.\n\nFocusing on activity in the Black Sea between October 18 and 27 of 2016, vessel GNSS\nreceivers in proximity to both Gelendzhik and Sochi fell victim to spoofing events\nwithin less than an hour of one another on multiple occasions. About half-way through\n\n\n-----\n\nthis period, the spoofing device located near Gelendzhik temporarily stopped directing\nreceivers to the Gelendzhik Airport and, instead, began to direct them to Vnukovo\nAirport in Moscow, more than 1,000 kilometers away. As activity appeared to taper off\nnear Gelendzhik, activity in waters near the Crimean city of Olyva began. This pattern\nof activity indicates that (1) at least two spoofing devices are in use in the Black Sea, (2)\nthese devices can be reprogrammed to spoof vessel receivers to multiple locations, and\n(3) spoofing activity at certain locations is not constant, and may even shift between\nlocations over time.\n\nFinally, through an analysis of the hourly distribution of activity, we can demonstrate\nthat spoofing events primarily take place during the day across all locations. In total,\n90 percent of events took place between the hours of 6:00 and 22:00 local time. One\nexplanation for the apparent dip in activity between midnight and the early hours of\nthe morning could be that the spoofing devices are only turned on when the operators\nare awake. A second potential explanation, examined later in this paper, is that the\nspoofing transmitters are used to protect the movements of high-value individuals\nduring the day.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Geography of Detected Activity_**\n\nThe scope of GNSS spoofing events appears to be far more indiscriminate, persistent,\nand widespread than previous public reporting suggests. In total, C4ADS found 9,883\nGNSS spoofing instances affecting 1,311 vessels across ten locations in Russia, Crimea,\nand Syria between February 2016 and November 2018. In addition to Moscow, Saint\nPetersburg, Sochi, and Gelendzhik, where GNSS spoofing activity was already known,\nC4ADS found evidence of newly discovered activities in Arkhangelsk in the Russian far\nnorth, Vladivostok in the far east, the Kerch Strait near the frontline with Ukraine, and\nSevastopol and Olyva on the Crimean Peninsula. Finally, working with researchers from\nUT Austin, we detected GNSS spoofing originating from Russia’s Khmeimim Airbase in\nSyria on three separate occasions.\n\n**_Scope of Detected Activity_**\n\nPrevious public reporting by the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation and CNN\nsuggests that only about 450 vessels fell victim to GNSS spoofing as of November\n2018.[41] However, C4ADS found that the total number of vessels spoofed during this\n\n\n-----\n\ntime may be closer to 1,311. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate that events near\nGelendzhik, Sochi, and Saint Petersburg comprise over 94 percent of all detected\nactivity. However, this trend may be related to limitations associated with our use of\nAIS as a proxy. Gelendzhik and Sochi, which experienced the most GNSS disruption\nwith 4,659 and 2,506 spoofing events, respectively, are both in close proximity to key\nmaritime transit and port facilities with a high density of GNSS receivers available to\ndetect the spoofed signals. Gelendzhik is located next to the Novorossiysk port, which\nis one of the largest deep-water ports in Russia and home to a large contingent of the\nRussian Black Sea Fleet[42] [43] while the Port of Sochi is a major destination and mooring\nlocation for passenger and luxury vessels.[44]\n\nIn areas where there are fewer receivers to report irregular activity, spoofing may\nbe much harder to detect using publicly available information, and is therefore not\nincluded in our dataset. However, based on the available data, we were able to observe\nsome key trends that have significant impacts on navigational safety.\n\n**_Trend I: GNSS Receivers are Spoofed to Multiple Locations_**\n\nWhile most affected locations in Russia and Crimea saw vessels spoofed to only one\nnearby airport, vessels off the coast of Gelendzhik and Kerch were spoofed to two or\nmore airports sequentially between 2016 and 2018. AIS data throughout this period\nindicate that vessels near Gelendzhik were spoofed to the Gelendzhik Airport, the\nSochi-Adler Airport, and the Vnukovo Airport in Moscow, as shown in the image on\n\n\n-----\n\nthe right. Additionally, vessels near Kerch\nreported spoofed positioning information\nat both the Simferopol Airport in Crimea\nand the Anapa Airport on the other side of\nthe Kerch Strait.\n\nThis change in where vessels are spoofed\nto is an indication that the GNSS spoofing\ndevices used in these regions can be\nreprogrammed to force victim receivers to\ndifferent coordinates at will. By examining\nthe approximate positions to which victim\nvessels had their positions spoofed, ‘hot\nspots’ at each airport can be observed. An\nexample of ‘hot spots’ at Gelendzhik airport,\nvisualized through the spoofed position\nfrequency distribution below, indicates\nthat destination coordinates may vary\nsignificantly across spoofing events over\ntime. This variation within the confines of\nthe airport could potentially be the result\nof either manual coordinate selection by\nthe device operator or by victim receiver\ncalculation errors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Trend II: Activity Takes Place Near Sensitive Government Airspace_**\n\nC4ADS found a high correlation between GNSS spoofing events and the presence of\nsensitive or prohibited airspace. In Russia and Crimea, we found at least 12 isolated and\nongoing GNSS disruptions. These instances appear to be localized in areas within close\nproximity to the Russian head of state and Russian government facilities operated\nby the FSO, as detailed below. In Syria, spoofing events took place in proximity to\nKhmeimim Airbase, which is protected by advanced Russian military EW and antiaircraft equipment.[45]\n\n|GNSS Spoofing Event Date|Location (Approx.)|GNSS Spoofing Type|Prohibited or Sensitive Airspace Present|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|February 2016 to Present|Gelendzhik, Russia|Denial-of-Service (False Coordinates)|Yes, prohibited airspace over residence allegedly tied to President Putin located near affected area.46 47|\n|March 2016 to Present|Sochi, Russia|Denial-of-Service (False Coordinates)|Yes,48 Riviera-6 and Bocharov Ruchey Government residences operated by Russian FSO49 are adjacent to Sochi Port and coast where highest levels of spoofing activity have been detected.|\n|May 28, 2016|Novo- Ogaryovo, Moscow, Russia|Denial-of-Service (False Coordinates)|Yes,50 took place within prohibited airspace with Russian presidential residence <1km away from affected receiver.51|\n|July 10, 2016 to Present|Central Moscow, Russia|Denial-of-Service (False Coordinates)|Yes,52 activity most prevalent near Kremlin.53|\n|August 31 to September 3, 2016|Vladivostok, Russia|Denial-of-Service (False Coordinates)|Likely, Russian president arrived in area on August 31 for 2016 Eastern Economic Forum and departed on September 3.

We found that\nGPS spoofing signals originating from Khmeimim Airbase in Syria, for example, would\nbe deafening for aircraft flying near the transmitter, subjecting them to spoofing signals\n500 times stronger than authentic GPS signals.[70] Similarly, based on the geographic\nscope and nature of these GNSS spoofing events, at least some of these activities may\nbe in contravention of the United Nation’s International Telecommunications Union\n(ITU) Radio Regulations Articles, which prohibit harmful radio frequency interference.[iv]\n\n71 C4ADS detected at least 7,910 instances where victim vessels located outside of\nRussian territorial waters fell victim to GNSS spoofing activity, potentially posing a risk\nto maritime navigational safety. A majority of these instances, for example, took place\noutside Russian territorial waters in the Black Sea, as seen in the image below.\n\nThese safety hazards are likely a spillover effect of actions taken in pursuit of Russian\nnational security objectives. In the following case studies, we will explore three\napplications of GNSS spoofing and in each identify potential systems and basing\nlocations.\n\niv According to Article 15 of the ITU’s Radio Regulation Articles, of which the Russian Federation is a party,\nstates agree to prohibit unrestricted signal transmissions that may interfere with safety systems.\n\n     - Section 1: All stations are forbidden to carry out unnecessary transmissions, or the transmission of\nsuperfluous signals, or the transmission of false or misleading signals, or the transmission of signals\nwithout identification (except as provided for in Article 19).\n\n     - Section 4: Special consideration shall be given to avoiding interference on distress and safety frequencies,\nthose related to distress and safety identified in Article 31 and those related to safety and regularity of\nflight identified in Appendix 27.\n\n\n-----\n\n## PROTECTING VIPS\n\nOne of the clearest use cases for GNSS spoofing in the Russian Federation is for the\nprotection of very important persons (VIP). C4ADS uncovered cases where GNSS\nspoofing in certain geographically isolated locations took place only in correlation with\nRussian leadership movements and FSO security activities. The purpose of this spoofing\nactivity was likely to prevent unauthorized civilian drone activity as a VIP protection\nmeasure.[i] Because many of these activities took place over brief time periods in isolated\nlocations, they support the working hypothesis that at least some of the devices used\nto conduct GNSS disruptions are mobile and can be temporarily deployed to create\nlocal areas of effect.\n\n**_The Kerch Bridge Visit_**\n\nThe Kerch Bridge was built after the Russian annexation of Crimea to link the Crimean\nPeninsula to mainland Russia. The Kerch Strait, where the bridge is situated, has become\na point of contention between Russia and Ukraine over the past several years, with\nRussia detaining three Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018 over accusations\nthat the vessels had strayed into Russian territorial waters.[72] C4ADS identified GNSS\nspoofing activities in proximity to the Kerch Bridge on only two occasions – on\nSeptember 15, 2016 and May 15, 2018. On both days, Russian President Vladimir Putin\nwas present in the area to oversee the progress and completion of the Kerch Bridge.\nVehicles suspected to belong to the Russian FSO could be seen following the Russian\npresident during both events.\n\n_September 15, 2016_\n\nOn September 15, 2016, the Russian President and Prime Minister made a single-day\ntrip to Kerch to examine progress on the Kerch Bridge.[73] That same day, vessels moored\nat the nearby Kerch Port reported false positioning information at the Simferopol\n\ni As previously mentioned, GNSS spoofing events detected in Russia are likely designed to deceive GNSS\nreceivers on commercial drones to activate firmware-level geofence locks that prevent these drones from flying in\nrestricted airspace such as an airport. If one of these commercial drones locks on to the spoofed signals, they would\neither return to what they perceive as ‘non-restricted’ airspace or disengage entirely before they reach the restricted\nairspace.\n\n\n-----\n\nAirport nearly 200km away in Crimea. This event was the first GNSS spoofing event\ndetected near Kerch, and the only one detected in 2016. According to official news\nreleases posted on the Kremlin’s website, the September 15 trip was the first and only\nofficial Presidential visit to Kerch in 2016.[74]\n\n_May 15, 2018_\n\nLess than two years later, President Putin returned to Kerch to take part in the\nofficial opening of the Kerch Bridge.[75] To celebrate the opening, Putin led a convoy of\nconstruction vehicles across the bridge from Russia to Crimea.[76] AIS records for vessels\nin the Kerch Strait at the time show that vessel passage through the straight was\nheavily restricted at the time of the event. It is during this time that at least 24 vessels\nanchored in waters in proximity to the bridge reported spoofed GNSS positioning\ninformation at the Anapa Airport more than 65km away. This was the only sustained\nspoofing disruption evidenced by AIS records in Kerch in 2018. Official news releases\nfrom the Kremlin indicate that the May 15 event was the only official Presidential visit\nto Kerch in 2018.[77]\n\nOn the same day as the May 2018 GNSS disruptions, vehicles suspected to belong\nto the FSO drove alongside Putin’s construction truck motorcade as it made its way\nacross the Kerch Bridge. Using a line of sight analysis to estimate the potential range of\na GNSS spoofing device, we can show that a spoofing transmitter based on one of the\nFSO vehicles at the Kerch bridge would likely be capable of targeting all vessels that\nreported spoofed location information on May 15, 2018.[ii]\n\nii Due to the physical limitations of ultra-high frequency GNSS signals, spoofed signals would generally be\nunable to pass through physical obstructions such as mountains. To determine visibility from the Kerch bridge,\nC4ADS used ArcGIS to process a 3D terrain maps of the area surrounding the bridge and calculated what would be\nin view of a transmitter positioned on the bridge.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The Zvezda Shipyard Visit_**\n\nThe Zvezda Shipyard is located near the remote Russian Far East town of Bolshoy\nKamen, 30km away from the port city of Vladivostok. For the past two years in early\nSeptember, vessel GNSS receivers stationed at the shipyard have reported false location\ninformation at the Vladivostok International Airport. As in Crimea, these disruptions\ncoincide directly with visits made by the Russian President to the shipyard, in this case\nfor the Eastern Economic Forum hosted in Vladivostok in 2017 and 2018.\n\n_September 8, 2017_\n\n\nOn his last day in Vladivostok for the 2017 Eastern\nEconomic Forum, President Putin visited Bolshoy\nKamen to inspect the newly constructed Zvezda\nShipyard. The official Kremlin website reported the\nvisit and the Russian President’s speech at 1:30pm\nlocal time.[78] At approximately 1:24pm local time, the\nonly vessel moored at the shipyard reported spoofed\npositioning information at the Vladivostok International\nAirport. This is the first and only detected instance of\nGNSS spoofing near Bolshoy Kamen in 2017.\n\n_September 11, 2018_\n\nApproximately one year after the first\nspoofing event detected at Zvezda\nShipyard, Putin returned to the facility\nto oversee the implementation of\nthe shipyard’s production projects.[79]\nOnce again, at least one vessel-based\nGNSS receiver located at the shipyard\nreported false positioning information\nat the Vladivostok Airport at the time\nof the president’s afternoon visit.\n\nThe temporary and isolated nature of\nthe GNSS spoofing detected near the\nKerch Bridge and Zvezda Shipyard\nstrongly suggests that the equipment\nused to create these disruptions could\nbe based on a mobile platform, and\nthat it is capable of creating localized\nzones of spoofing.\n\n\nPutin's Speach at Zvezda Shipyard\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Potential Systems in Use (Mobile)_**\n\nBased on the pattern of spoofing activity outlined above, it is reasonable to assume that\nthe FSO likely possesses EW systems capable of producing the type of interference\nseen in our investigation. In 2016, an unnamed official who claimed to have direct\nknowledge of EW systems used by the FSO near the Kremlin told the Russian outlet\nVedomosti that the FSO was likely using the “Shipovnik-Aero or some close analog\nto it.”[80] According to official documentation and the information sheet shown in the\nimage on the right, the Shipovnik-Aero is a military-grade EW system based on a\nKamaz vehicle frame that can be used to suppress unmanned aerial vehicle systems\nby creating a false navigation field, thereby forcing drones to land.[81] [82] However, a\nrepresentative from the United Instrument-Making Corporation (UIMC), the company\nthat produces the Shipovnik-Aero, denied that the system is in use by the special\nservices at the Kremlin.[83] [84]\n\nBased on our analysis of the use of GNSS\nspoofing for VIP protection, we believe that the\nGNSS spoofing device (or devices) used in Kerch\nand Vladivostok are likely mobile, able to be\nturned on and off to create local areas of effect,\nand are potentially operated by the FSO.\n\nUsing these specifications and the leads\ngenerated by Vedomosti in 2016 as guidance,\nC4ADS examined over a thousand contracts in the\nofficial Russian government contracts registry\nin search of equipment purchases potentially\nrelated to GNSS spoofing infrastructure.[85] In line\nwith UIMC’s official stance that it did not supply\nShipovnik-Aero systems to the FSO, C4ADS did\nnot find any public contracts between UIMC\nand the FSO.\n\nHowever, C4ADS did locate numerous FSO procurement contracts and repair\nagreements for several mobile electronic countermeasure systems, including the\n“Shipovnik-4800M” and the “Shipovnik-M.” These systems are produced not by UIMC,\nbut rather by a joint stock company based in the town of Vladimir named JSC Design\nSkilled Office of Radio Equipment (JSC KOBRA).[86] [87]\n\nAccording to a June 2009 issue of Mayak, a trade publication, JSC KOBRA was at one\ntime the sole supplier of equipment used for radio-control and monitoring near the\nKremlin and the Russian White House.[88] In its online catalogue, JSC KOBRA offers\nseveral electronic countermeasure systems, including ones designed to neutralize\ncommercial drones by counteracting the communication channels of GLONASS, GPS,\nGALILEO, and COMPASS.[89]\n\nNo references to either the Shipovnik-4800M or the Shipovnik-M could be found in\npublic media sources or on JSC KOBRA’s website. The 2009 issue of Mayak references\nboth the Shipovnik-95 and the Shipovnik-98 as systems supplied to the FSO by JSC\n\n\n-----\n\nKOBRA for radio signal suppression.[90] The article also claimed that the FSO has\ndeployed the Shipovnik-95 on Russian presidential escort vehicles.[91] [92]\n\nOfficial government records, shown below, indicate that in August 2014 the Arms\nAdministration of the Engineering and Technical Support Service of the FSO with a\nlisted address at the Kremlin purchased five Shipovnik-4800M portable electronic\ncountermeasure complexes for about $120,400 each.[93] [94] [95]\n\nIn October 2015, the Caucasus branch of the FSO, based in Sochi and responsible for\nsecurity activities at government residences on the Black Sea coast, finalized a contract\nwith JSC KOBRA for the repair of a “mobile radio-electronic countermeasure complex”\nnamed the Shipovnik-M.[96]\n\nThe specifications and potential capabilities of both the Shipovnik-4800M and\nShipovnik-M could not be identified through official records. Records from the Russian\nFederal Accreditation Service, responsible for issuing regulatory certifications for\nequipment, describe the Shipovnik-4800M as “portable electronic countermeasure\nequipment” that is able to operate on battery power.[97] [98]\n\nThe FSO procured several mobile EW devices for its branches in Moscow and Sochi,\nwhich appear to belong to a family of systems used for presidential motorcade\nprotection. While we cannot say for certain that these mobile systems are behind the\nisolated spoofing activity detected near the Russian president, learning more about\nthem gives us a better understanding of potential systems in play.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DEFENDING STRATEGIC FACILITIES\n\nIn addition to the protection of Russian leaders, C4ADS found evidence that GNSS\nspoofing is used to protect strategic Russian government residences and other highlysensitive facilities near the Black Sea and in Moscow. Unlike the spoofing activity\nassociated with VIP visits to remote locations, the activity seen in the vicinity of static\ngovernment facilities is more frequent, affects a greater number of vessels, and appears\nto interfere with receivers over a greater distance.\n\n**_Official Russian Government Facilities_**\n\nC4ADS observed patterns of GNSS spoofing around official Russian buildings in both\nMoscow and on the Russian Black Sea coast. In Sochi and Olyva, GNSS spoofing\ninterfered with vessel navigation systems off the coast of official government\nresidences owned and operated by the FSO. Similarly, potential spoofing activity\noccurred near the Kremlin and the Presidential Residence in Moscow. These facilities\nare publicly acknowledged as belonging to the Russian government and are afforded\nspecial airspace protections reserved for strategic government and military facilities. In\nall cases, GNSS spoofing disruptions beginning in 2016 forced victim receivers to report\npositions at local civilian airports. These events have continued to affect receivers as of\nthe time of this report’s publication.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Black Sea Residences_\n\nAeronavigation charts dated July 2017 and August 2018 from the Russian Center of\nAeronavigation Information show that the airspaces above two facilities in Sochi and\na large swath of the southern coast of Crimea near Olyva are classified as prohibited.[99]\n\n100 Prohibited is the strictest classification for airspace in the Russian Federation and is\ntypically used for airspace over highly sensitive government and military installations.[101]\nIn Sochi, the Russian presidential and prime ministerial residences of Bocharov Ruchey\nand Riviera-6, respectively, are located in the center of two prohibited airspaces.\nSimilarly, the prohibited airspace along the southern coast of Crimea is situated above\na string of coastal residences that are now occupied by the Russian government.[102]\n\nThe Bocharov Ruchey and Riviera-6 residences in Sochi are widely reported to be\noverseen by the Caucasus branch of the FSO, which is responsible for the protection\nof all government residences in the south of the country.[103] [104] Similarly, in December\n2016, following the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, Crimean authorities\ntransferred control of five government residences located in Foros and Olyva to the\nCrimean branch of the Russian FSO.[105]\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Crimean news and social media reports, significant FSO security\nactivities began at the government dachas and residences around March 2016, several\nmonths before the first detection of GNSS spoofing in the region.[106] In addition to FSO\ncheckpoints and brick walls now surrounding the complexes, images of large security\nfences bordering the highway to the north have emerged on social media accounts.[107]\n\n108\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Potential Systems in Use (Stationary)_**\n\nDue to heightened security around the Black Sea dachas and residences, C4ADS was\nunable to collect data on the systems potentially in use at these facilities. However, the\narea around the Kremlin in central Moscow is more prone to analysis using public data.\nAlready, Russian researchers have recorded possible spoofing activity near the Kremlin.\nIn October 2016, a researcher driving around central Moscow on a Segway reportedly\nused a collection of receivers to detect GPS and GLONASS interference signals near\nthe Kremlin.[109] Similarly, in September 2017, a researcher searching for the source of\nMoscow’s GPS spoofing found that the spoofed signals likely originate from a position\noutside, rather than inside, the Kremlin.[110]\n\n_Suspected Kremlin Counter-Drone Systems_\n\nBased on leads generated by Russian journalists and hobbyists searching for the source\nof Moscow’s GNSS spoofing,[111] [112] C4ADS identified possible GNSS spoofing equipment\nbased on at least three buildings in central Moscow. All three buildings host what appear\nto be identical antennas and transmission equipment on their rooftops. According\nto publicly available imagery, the antennas appear to face the Kremlin. Two of the\nbuildings are openly owned by the Russian government, the third inexplicably lacks\nofficial ownership information in local property records.[113] The equipment at all three\nlocations first appeared between June 2015 and September 2016 on street mapping\nwebsites, or within the time frame that GNSS spoofing activity was first reported near\nthe Kremlin.[114]\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nbefore the road was shut to the public, shows at least 10 vehicles with serialized license\nplate numbers ending in OO77 parked outside the building.[124] [125] According to several\npublicly available Russian DMV databases reviewed by C4ADS, this serialization pattern\nhas been previously associated with vehicles belonging to the Office of the President\nof the Russian Federation.[126]\n\n\n**_Unofficial Government Facilities_**\n\nIn contrast to areas where an official government presence made the placement of a\nGNSS spoofing device a logical protective measure, spoofing activity off the coast off\nGelendzhik did not appear to have an obvious explanation. The coast near Gelendzhik\ndoes not have any declared government residences. Despite this, spoofing events off\nthe Gelendzhik coast were the most frequent in our sample. We wanted to find the\nlikely source of this activity, and so we turned to local media reports and an abundance\nof spoofed vessel position data to narrow our search.\n\nGelendzhik is frequented by security service officials, which is in line with popular but\nunconfirmed reports that President Vladimir Putin maintains a private residence in\nthe outskirts of the town.[127] [128] [129] Following an examination of several hypotheses, we\nbelieve that the GNSS spoofing system in use near Gelendzhik is land-based.[130] Given\nthe frequent nature of GNSS spoofing activity near Gelendzhik and its wide-reaching\neffects on vessels in the area, we posited that the device has access to a reliable and\nsustained source of electricity.\n\n_Aggregated Line of Sight Analysis_\n\nTo trace back to high-probability basing locations for spoofing devices in use near\nGelendzhik, C4ADS conducted an aggregated line of sight analysis. Due to the physical\nlimitations of ultra-high frequency GNSS signals, spoofed signals would generally\nbe unable to pass through physical obstructions such as mountains.[131] To determine\n\n\n-----\n\nvisibility from a given location, C4ADS used ArcGIS to process 3D terrain maps of the\narea around Gelendzhik. Using AIS positioning data from 1,920 spoofing instances,\nwe calculated the areas along the coastline that would be able to “see” all or nearly\nall of the vessels in our dataset. Based on these line of sight calculations for affected\nvessel receiver positions, we were able to narrow down potential basing areas to just\na few land-based locations. The results indicated that only one facility located at Cape\nIdokopas appeared to have line of sight with more than 98% of the affected vesselbased receivers.\n\n_Cape Idokopas Residence_\n\nCape Idokopas, located about 20km to the southeast of Gelendzhik, Russia, appears\nto be the most likely location for a terrestrial GNSS spoofing transmitter. The analysis\nindicates that it is located in proximity to several positions that have line of sight\nwith at least 98 percent of affected vessels off the coast of Gelendzhik. The Cape is\nhome to a sprawling facility containing a large Italianate palace, several helicopter\npads, an amphitheater, and a small port. The complex was the subject of extensive\ninternational investigative reporting that alleged the property was built at the direction\nof then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin under the auspices of an investment scheme\nreferred to as “Project South,” allegedly for use as his private dacha.[132] [133] [134] The Russian\ngovernment continues to deny that President Putin has any involvement with the\n\n\n-----\n\nfacility.[135] [136] Regardless, high profile allegations of corruption have long dogged the\nproject. Investigative reporting by Reuters in 2014 indicated that funds from a $1 billion\nprogram ordered by then-President Putin in 2005 to improve Russian healthcare were\nused to finance the construction of the facility.[137]\n\nAeronavigation charts dated July 2017 from the Russian Center of Aeronavigation\nInformation show that the airspace above the Idokopas facility is classified as\nProhibited.[138] [139] The facility maintains the same level of flight restriction that exists\nover the presidential and prime ministerial residences in Sochi.[140] However, unlike the\nofficial government residences and protected military facilities in Russia and Crimea,\nthe prohibited airspace over Cape Idokopas appears to only protect a private residence.\nAs discussed below, extensive property and corporate records along with previous\ninvestigative reporting outlined below suggest that the facility has an opaque history\nof involvement with elements of the FSO and Federal Security Service (FSB).[141]\n\nFor example, facility construction activities appear to have some associations with the\nFSO. In 2017, a newly constructed port appeared to the south of the Cape Idokopas palace.\nAIS records and satellite imagery indicate that a vessel called the Chernomorets-35\nwas present during, and may have assisted in, the development of the port.[142] Official\nrecords from the Russian contract registry show that 70 percent of the ship owner’s\ncontracts were with elements of the Russian state security services including the FSO,\nFSB, and the Presidential Administration.[143] This is supported by AIS records for the\nChernomorets-35, which suggest that the vessel is one of a relatively small number\npermitted to operate at the FSO-operated government residences at Bocharov Ruchey,\nRiviera-6, and Olyva.[144] In fact, the majority of areas visited by Chernomorets-35 appear\nto be officially owned or operated by elements of the FSO.[145]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Chernomorets-35 is the only vessel that fell victim to GNSS spoofing in proximity to\nSochi, Gelendzhik, and Olyva while reportedly conducting construction activities at the\ngovernment and private residences located nearby. The vessel’s close position to the\ncoast and proximity to sensitive facilities when it was affected by spoofed signals are\nadditional indications that the spoofing devices may be positioned near the facilities\nthemselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Idokopas Palace Ownership_**\n\nC4ADS conducted an extensive property and corporate records analysis of the Cape\nIdokopas residence, matching it with previous investigative reporting. We found an\nopaque history of involvement with elements of the FSO and FSB.\n\nAccording to official property records from the Russian cadastral registry last accessed\nby C4ADS in July 2018, the Gelendzhik-based company Kompleks LLC[146] is the sole\nowner of the Idokopas facility.[147] These same records indicated that Kompleks LLC\nbecame the owner of the facility on or before May 27, 2013. Official property records\nalso show that the road and land bordering the main entrance to the facility is owned\nby the FSB’s Border Directorate.[148] These records indicate that the FSB acquired the\nland on May 19, 2008.[149] It is currently unknown whether the FSB maintains an active\npresence at the facility. On at least one occasion in February 2011, environmentalists\nfrom the Russian organization Ecological Watch visiting the Cape Idokopas palace were\nconfronted by facility security. This incident involved guards allegedly belonging to the\nborder force, as well as an officer bearing patches and epaulets resembling those of a\nSenior Lieutenant in the FSO.[150] [151]\n\nHistorical ownership records for Kompleks LLC appear to show that at the time of\nthe property’s purchase in May 2013, 100 percent of Kompleks LLC’s shares belonged\nto Moscow-based Investstroy LLC.[152] [153] [154] According to Russian corporate records, at\nthe time that Kompleks LLC purchased the property, two Russian individuals named\n\n\n-----\n\nTatyana Arnoldovna Kuznetsova and Inna Yuryevna Kolpakova were the sole equal\nshareholders of Investstroy LLC.[155] According to reporting from several Russian news\nagencies, both Tatyana Kuznetsova and Inna Kolpakova are married to former highranking officers in the FSO.[156] [157] [158]\n\nTatyana Kuznetsova is reportedly the wife of Oleg Sergeyevich Kuznetsov, who is\nreported to have previously served as the head of Military Unit 1473 of the FSO.[159] [160]\nUnit 1473, based in Moscow, is responsible for the management and operation of real\nestate belonging to the Russian state security services.[161] Inna Kolpakova is reportedly\nthe wife of Alexandr Sergeyevich Koplakov who reportedly formerly served as the\nhead of Directorate ‘V’ of the FSO Presidential Security Service until 2013.[162] [163] The FSO\nPresidential Security Service is directly tasked with protecting the Russian Head of\nState.[164]\n\nA contract signed pursuant to a 2005 investment agreement, published by the Russian\nnewspaper Novaya Gazeta, indicates that Oleg Kuznetsov and Unit 1473 maintained\ninvolvement in the initial stages of development of the Cape Idokopas facility.[165] [166] [167]\nThese same documents also appear to show the involvement of Vladimir Kozhin in\nthe development of the property at the same time that he was working as an aide to\nthe Russian president.[168] The US Department of the Treasury sanctioned Kozhin under\nExecutive Order 13661 in 2014 in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea.[169] In an\nApril 2011 interview with Kommersant, Kozhin confirmed his involvement in the initial\nstages of the property’s development, but claimed that it was only to encourage real\nestate development among investors.[170]\n\nNovaya Gazeta reported that, in 2010, a Russian whistleblower who claimed to have\nbeen involved in the financing of the Cape Idokopas palace, alleged that construction\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## MILITARY PROTECTION ABROAD\n\nWhile much of the previous reporting on GNSS spoofing has focused on where these\nactivities appear within Russia, less attention has been paid to how these capabilities\nmay be integrated into expeditionary force protection abroad. Using publicly available\nsatellite data, we were able to uncover evidence that systems used to spoof GNSS\nsignals are also being deployed on the ground in Syria. This work builds on previous\npublic reporting on GPS interference activity reported in the Eastern Mediterranean,[179]\nSyria,[180] [181] Norway,[182] and Finland.[183]\n\n**_From Jamming to Spoofing in Syria_**\n\nSyria is a testbed for a range of Russian military equipment, including new EW assets.\nIn April 2018, the head of US SOCOM Gen. Tony Thomas referred to Syria as, “the most\naggressive electronic warfare environment in the world.”[184] By some reports, GPS\ninterference activities in Syria have been on the cutting edge, and Russia’s deployment\nof EW capabilities has successfully targeted smaller US military drones.[185]\n\nC4ADS and UT Austin used a GPS receiver onboard the International Space Station\n(ISS) to record, characterize, and ultimately geolocate a denial-of-service GPS spoofing\ntransmitter to the Khmeimim Airbase in Syria. The research began in March 2018 when\nresearchers from UT Austin detected evidence of GPS interference when examining\nhistorical GPS signal recordings collected from the ISS. In an effort to further characterize\nthe GPS interference, C4ADS and UT Austin collaborated to conduct three independent\nGPS signal recordings over several months in the spring of 2018. On all three days of\ncollection, researchers from UT Austin found clear evidence of GPS spoofing in the\nrecorded signal data. Moreover, UT Austin researchers successfully geolocated the\nsource of the signals in all three samples to Khmeimim Airbase, the nerve center of the\nRussian military campaign in Syria.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on an analysis of the Doppler signatures in the tracked data, we assess that\nthe interference signals captured on all three days were likely generated by the same\ntransmitter. This analysis has broader implications, specifically on how emerging civilian\ncapabilities, such as cheap LEO satellites, combined with technical expertise, can be\nused to identify and track disruptions to GNSS worldwide.\n\nUT Austin researchers found that while the signals successfully mimicked authentic\nGPS satellites, they carried no valid navigation information. In essence, GPS receivers\ntargeted by these spoofed signals would report live GPS satellite connections but\nwould be unable to calculate any valid positioning or timing information, which\nwould effectively render the receivers inoperable. Furthermore, UT Austin researchers\ndetermined that the spoofing signals would be upwards of 500 times stronger\nthan authentic GNSS signals for aircraft flying within line of sight of the transmitter,\npresenting a direct safety threat to commercial aviation in range of the transmissions.\n\nBecause denial-of-service spoofing would prevent receivers from calculating any\nnavigation information, this activity may appear to be jamming, which has been\nwidely reported in the Eastern Mediterranean in recent years. In late 2018, for example,\nEurocontrol reported GNSS jamming activity originating from Syrian territory and\nidentified high probability locations in the Eastern Mediterranean from which the\ninterference appeared to originate.[186] [187]\n\n\n-----\n\nThis interference, however, may well be the product of spoofing, and not just jamming.\nGPS interference reports posted on the US Coast Guard Navigation Center’s website\nfrom ships based in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, for example, mirror the pattern\nof activity that would be expected of a receiver affected by the spoofed GPS signals\ndetected at Khmeimim. In these reports, several vessel GPS receivers in proximity to\none another reported satellite signal locks but could not calculate any valid positioning\ninformation.\n\nIn the context of these reports, C4ADS and UT Austin’s findings bring to light the\npossibility that at least some of the GPS interference taking place in Syria and the\nEastern Mediterranean may, in fact, be denial-of-service GPS spoofing.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Potential Systems in Use (Military)_**\n\nKhmeimim Airbase, where the spoofed GPS signals appear to originate, serves as\none of the primary staging locations for Russian military sorties in Syria. Since 2013,\nKheimim has undergone heavy reconstruction and now supports and protects the\nmost advanced Russian military assets deployed in Syria. According to a series of\nagreements signed between Russia and Syria in 2016 and 2017, Russian forces maintain\nfull authority over air defense and rule of law within the territory of the facility.[188] [189] The\nairbase houses Russia’s latest military assets, including S-400 surface-to-air missile\nbatteries, the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft system, and Su-57 stealth fighters.[190] While the\nRussian military regularly displays these systems publicly on Russian media outlets,\nEW systems deployed at the airbase have generally avoided the limelight.[191] Many\nvideos allegedly revealing the basing location for these systems are no longer online.[192]\n\n\n-----\n\nKhmeimim has been a target of air attacks in the past. On January 5, 2018, a drone\nswarm consisting of 13 drones carrying explosive fragmentation munitions reportedly\nattacked from the east.[193] The drones, reportedly all launched from the same location\nabout 96km from Khmeimim, came pre-programmed with flight path coordinates,\nsuggesting that the drones likely used GNSS for navigation assistance.[194] According to\nthe Russian Ministry of Defense, Russian EW systems based at Khmeimim forced at\nleast six of the drones to land at “assigned coordinates” while Pantsir S1 anti-aircraft\nsystems neutralized the remaining seven drones.[195] Based on this official description,\nit is possible that Russian EW systems targeted GNSS receivers onboard the drones in\norder to force them to land.\n\nCommercial drones deployed by non-state combatants in warzones like Syria often\nhave their geofencing restrictions removed to bypass flight restrictions over much\nof Syria and Iraq.[196] This means that GNSS spoofing designed to trigger typical drone\ngeofence locks, as seen in Russia, cannot be used to disable these modified drones.\nDrones are now used consistently by combatants for reconnaissance purposes and to\ndeliver low-yield payloads to protected targets such as ammo depots and airports.[197] In\na militarized environment where geofences are not an effective tool, Russia has to rely\non more other methods such as this unique form of denial of service spoofing to target\nand bring down homemade drones.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has not detailed the specific EW systems deployed\nin Syria, but at least two systems potentially capable of performing counter-drone\nmissions by targeting GNSS are now confirmed or likely to be present in Syria.\n\n**Electronic** **Reported Capabilities** **Spotted in Syria**\n**Warfare System**\n\nConflicting reports on capabilities, believed to be a c.

A video of Aleppo Airport posted around December 2016\nshow what appears to be a towable phased antenna array assembly belonging to the\nR-330Zh.[213] As opposed to the Krasukha-4, the R-330Zh’s ability to jam and manipulate\nGPS systems is officially recognized by the Russian government.[214] C4ADS conducted\nan analysis of satellite imagery available for Khmeimim Airbase for dates near when\nwe detected GPS spoofing. However, C4ADS could not confirm, with confidence, the\npresence of the R-330Zh at the Khmeimim Airbase due to limitations in the resolution\nof the imagery.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Unknown Hangars_\n\nIn June 2017 and February 2018, two closed-off elliptic hangar-like structures, reportedly\nused to house delicate equipment including UAV components and other sensors,\nappeared within the high-probability transmitter basing area identified by UT Austin\nresearchers.[215] According to the researchers’ estimates, these hangars are located\nwithin the 99 percent probability basing area.\n\nBased on available imagery, it is believed that the hangar constructed in June 2017\nis not directly connected to the tarmac and would therefore be an unlikely basing\nlocation for aircraft. Additionally, the hangar appears to include an elevated arm that\ncould potentially be used to mask an antenna. The hangars themselves appear to be\ndesigned to prevent satellites or individuals stationed at the facility from photographing\nthe hardware positioned inside the hangars. It is currently unconfirmed whether these\nstructures are directly tied to the detected GPS spoofing activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThrough C4ADS’ investigation into GNSS spoofing activities taking place in the Russian\nFederation, Crimea, and Syria, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging\npublicly available signals, official records, social and news media, and technology to develop\nan enhanced awareness of the potential actors, systems, and locations used to conduct these\nactivities. The systems-level analyses and case studies detailed in this report expose just a\nfraction of the GNSS interference activities taking place worldwide. However, our research\nindicates that Russia continues to act as a pioneer in this space, exposing its willingness to\nnot only deploy these capabilities in protection of VIPs and strategically-important facilities,\nbut also to leverage these techniques to promote its ventures at frontiers in Syria and Russia’s\nEuropean borders. Russia’s continued development and deployment of systems designed\nto spoof GNSS and counteract NATO’s decisive advantage in C4ISR capabilities at forwardoperating locations in Syria and Kaliningrad presents a unique challenge to the security of\ncritical national infrastructure.\n\nWhile the GNSS spoofing activities against civilian GNSS systems detailed in this report\nidentify capabilities used by state-level actors, the tools and methodologies for conducting\nsimilar activities are readily available to non-state actors. State and non-state actors engaged\nin illicit activity continue to show the lengths to which they are willing to go in order to both\nconduct and conceal their operations.[216] While the commercial availability and concealability\nof these do-it-yourself devices present a unique set of challenges for deterring both lone-wolf\nand coordinated spoofing activities, state-sponsored activities against civilian GNSS receivers\ncontinue to show how impactful these activities can be against vulnerable systems. Whether\nfor profit, protection, or disruption, illicit actors, writ large, stand to gain from the proliferation\nof these capabilities.\n\nThe tools used to conduct this activity may be openly available, but so too are the technologies\nand methodologies for detecting, tracking, and geolocating these activities. This report aims\nto demonstrate the utility of combining subject matter expertise, like that from the University\nof Texas at Austin, with data-driven analysis to develop unique approaches for collecting,\nanalyzing, and ultimately addressing GNSS spoofing activities. The techniques for finding\nGNSS spoofing detailed in this report are both replicable and highly extensible. Any system that\nreports GNSS-derived location information, like aircraft or mobile devices, can potentially be\nexploited to identify GNSS spoofing events affecting aircraft or ground-based GNSS receivers.\nMoreover, the collaboration between C4ADS and UT Austin researchers shows how GNSS\nreceivers based on low-Earth-orbit satellites can be used to detect and geolocate interference\nsignals worldwide. As private satellite firms continue to launch small and relatively inexpensive\npayloads into low-Earth-orbit, the commercial availability of GNSS receiver data that can be\nused to detect this interference will continue to proliferate.\n\nSignificant opportunities exist for both public and private sector organizations to get ahead\nof the curve and address these challenges head-on. Increased public awareness of GNSS\ninterference threats can lead to not only a more measured and proportional response by\nprivate sector organizations, but also a more open discussion on how these threats can be\nsuccessfully mitigated. Public efforts to protect, toughen, and augment existing PNT systems,\nsuch as those promoted by the RNT Foundation, combined with evidence-based reporting on\nthese issues, can serve to enhance this dialogue.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Endnotes\n\n1 North Korean GPS jamming reportedly disrupted over 1,000 commercial airliners and\nmilitary systems in 2016, see https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a20289/\nnorth-korea-jamming-gps-signals/\n\n2 Chinese military journals discuss how to use anti-satellite weapons and EW to degrade\nAmerican C4ISR systems, see http://caod.oriprobe.com/articles/39227089/Research_on_\ninterference_effectiveness_analysis_of_high_altitude_UAV_airborne_GPS_INS_system.htm\n\n3 Jane’s International Defence reports that the Russian Federation is actively refining its\nability to detect electromagnetic signatures to guide artillery barrages against Ukrainian soldiers\nin the disputed regions of the Donbass, see https://www.janes.com/images/assets/111/80111/\nThe_Czar_of_battle_Russian_artillery_use_in_Ukraine_portends_advances.pdf\n\n4 Data similar to that used by C4ADS and UT Austin in this study can be obtained through\ncommercial vendors specializing in LEO satellite data.

Using historical flight path data collected through ADS-B\nExchange (https://www.adsbexchange.com/), we found that aircraft operated by the Russian\nSpecial Flight Detachment, tasked with providing transportation and communications support\nfor the Russian head of state and government delegations, conduct regular support missions\n\n\n-----\n\nover Gelendzhik, Sochi, Kerch, and Crimea. While we found that these aircraft, namely the Tu214SR, conducted support missions over affected areas when we detected GNSS spoofing,\nwe also found that spoofing took place independent of these aircraft being on-station. This\ncould be the result of gaps in data or that these aircraft do not consistently broadcast ADS-B or\nMode-S signals when conducting these missions. At this time, C4ADS has not found evidence\nto suggest that civilian or governmental aircraft are conducting GNSS spoofing activities near\nGelendzhik.\n\n131 Paul D.
