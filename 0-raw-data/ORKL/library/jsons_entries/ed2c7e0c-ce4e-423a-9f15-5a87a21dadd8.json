    "plain_text": "# SideCopy APT: from Windows to *nix\n\n**telsy.com/sidecopy-apt-from-windows-to-nix/**\n\nJanuary 5, 2022\n\n[Cyber Threat Intelligence](https://www.telsy.com/category/cyber-threat-intelligence/)\n05 Jan\nTelsy Threat Intelligence team has observed a spear-phishing campaign conducted by cyberespionage group SideCopy against critical government entities in India.\n\n[As previously published by 'TALOS Cisco Security Research' also in this campaign, in](https://s3.amazonaws.com/talos-intelligence-site/production/document_files/files/000/095/591/original/062521_SideCopy_%281%29.pdf?1625657388)\naddition to the military themes, SideCopy used publications, invitations to submit\ndocuments/proposals and reproduced phishing portals posing as Indian government webmail\nto trick victims into divulging their e-mail credentials.\n\n**_SideCopy‘s delivery infrastructure consists of using compromised websites to deliver_**\nmalicious artefacts to specific victims. In this campaign, the portal\n'hxxp://assessment.mojochamps.com' was compromised, the WebShell named 'WSO\n**_version 4.2.5' was uploaded, and the infection chain began to spread._**\n\nThe infection chain for Windows systems has remained relatively consistent with minor\nvariations, but unlike previous observations an infection chain for *nix systems has been\nintroduced. SideCopy continued to send spear-phishing e-mails with malicious file\nattachments ranging from WEB links to LNKs that installed remote access trojans (RATs) on\ninfected systems.\n\nIn addition, SideCopy [used the BackNet agent in some infection chains. BackNet is a](https://github.com/Vinatechvn/backnet)\nPython Remote Access Tool. It is made of two main programs:\n\n\n-----\n\n– A Command and Control server, which is a Web interface to administer the agents\n\n– An agent program, which is run on the compromised host, and ensures communication\nwith the Command and Control.\n\nThe agent can be compiled to native executables using pyinstaller and is therefore\ncompatible with both Windows and *nix operating systems.\n\nThe portal 'hxxp://assessment.mojochamps.com', compromised by the threat actor, had\nmalconfigured open directories that allowed access to directories and files saved by the\ncyber-espionage group.\n\nThe analysis of the files on the compromised website made it possible to draw up a timeline\nof the activities conducted by the SideCopy group. Between the upload of the first WebShell\nand the last reported activity, which appears to be the creation of the Indian government’s\nwebmail phishing page, there were various activities such as uploading PHP and ELF files\nalong with decoy documents.\n\nThe following storyline omits the decoy documents upload.\n\nDepending on the context and modus operandi, all PHP and other files are consistent with\neach other, which makes it possible that the compromised site was used by the same threat\nactor to target only India.\n\nTypically, the purpose of the PHP pages was to record the source IP and user agent of the\nvisitor in a text file and then redirect the user to the malicious file or a decoy file depending\non the purpose of the page.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Map of visitors’ IPs_\n\nAnalysis of the log files generated by the PHP pages was able to identify around 400 unique\nIPs, most of which were concentrated in India. Some of these IPs were attributed to Indian\ngovernmental and civil organisations by analysing the information contained in the Whois\nregistry databases. For example:\n\n– M.P. Power Management Company Limited\n\n– Power System Operation Corporation Limited\n\n– Inspector General of Police\n\n– Chief of Naval Staff\n\n– National Remote Sensing Agency.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Map of Indian visitor IPs_\n\n## Fill the form below to download the full report\n\n[Check other cyber reports on our blog.](https://www.telsy.com/category/cyber-threat-intelligence/)\n\nThis report was produced by Telsy’s “Cyber Threat Intelligence” team with the help of its CTI\nplatform, which allows to analyze and stay updated on adversaries and threats that could\nimpact customers’ business.\n\n\n-----",
