It was last updated on February 7, 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\n## October\n\nWe terminated 9 YouTube channels and 1 ads account as part of our investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations linked to Vietnam. The campaign uploaded\nconspiracy theory content in English and Korean. We believe this operation was\nfinancially motivated\nWe terminated 4 AdSense accounts and blocked 22 domains from eligibility to appear\non Google News surfaces and Discover as part of our investigation into a reported\ncoordinated influence operation linked to India. The campaign uploaded a variety of\nnews content in English to domains that were designed to look as if they were\nindependent news outlets in various US states and European countries. We believe\nthis operation was financially motivated. We received leads from the FBI that supported\nus in this investigation.\nWe terminated 37 YouTube channels and 4 blogs as part of our investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations linked to Sudan. The campaign uploaded content in\nArabic that was supportive of the Sudanese military. Our findings are similar to findings\nreported by Facebook.\nWe terminated 3 YouTube channels as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Uganda. The campaign uploaded content in English that\nwas critical of Ugandan opposition political parties. Our findings are similar to findings\nreported by Twitter.\nWe terminated 3,311 YouTube channels as part of our ongoing investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations linked to China. These channels mostly uploaded\nspammy content in Chinese about music, entertainment, and lifestyle. A very small\nsubset uploaded content in Chinese and English about China’s COVID-19 vaccine\nefforts and social issues in the U.S. These findings are consistent with our previous\nreports.\n\n## November\n\nWe terminated 86 YouTube channels and 3 blogs as part of our investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations linked to Nicaragua. The campaign posted content in\nSpanish that was supportive of the Nicaraguan government and critical of opposition\npolitical parties. Our findings are similar to findings reported by Facebook.\nWe terminated 15,368 YouTube channels as part of our ongoing investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations linked to China. These channels mostly uploaded\nspammy content in Chinese about music, entertainment, and lifestyle. A very small\nsubset uploaded content in Chinese and English about China’s COVID-19 vaccine\nefforts and social issues in the U.S. These findings are consistent with our previous\nreports. The increased takedown volume compared to prior months is the result of\nadjustments made to our detection model, and we do not believe it reflects an increase\nin activity by this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n## December\n\nWe terminated 1 YouTube channel as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Iran. The campaign uploaded content in English that was\nsupportive of US politicians.\nWe terminated 15 YouTube channels and 1 Blogger blog as part of our investigation\ninto coordinated influence operations linked to Palestine. The campaign uploaded\ncontent in Arabic that was critical of Israel and supportive of Palestine and the Egyptian\nMuslim Brotherhood. Our findings are similar to findings reported by Meta.\nWe terminated 10 YouTube channels as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Belarus. The campaign uploaded content in Arabic that\nnegatively characterized the treatment and conditions of Muslim migrants in Belarus.\nOur findings are similar to findings reported by Meta.\nWe terminated 2 YouTube channels and 1 Ads account as part of our investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations. The campaign uploaded content in French that was\nsupportive of candidates in past elections in the Central African Republic.\nWe terminated 7 YouTube channels as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Russia. The campaign was linked to the Russian news\nagency ANNA News and was uploading content in Russian that was about military\nactivity in the Middle East. We received leads from Miburo Solutions that supported us\nin this investigation.\nWe terminated 99 YouTube channels as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Russia. The campaign was linked to a Russian\nconsulting firm and was posting content in Russian that was supportive of the United\nRussia party and critical of its opposition.\nWe terminated 8 YouTube channels as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Russia. The campaign was uploading content in Russian\nthat was critical of Russian opposition parties.\nWe terminated 1 YouTube channel as part of our investigation into coordinated\ninfluence operations linked to Russia. The campaign uploaded content in English\npertaining to military conflicts in the Middle East. We received leads from Miburo\nSolutions that supported us in this investigation.\nWe terminated 5460 YouTube channels as part of our ongoing investigation into\ncoordinated influence operations linked to China. These channels mostly uploaded\nspammy content in Chinese about music, entertainment, and lifestyle. A very small\nsubset uploaded content in Chinese and English about China’s COVID-19 vaccine\nefforts and social issues in the U.S. These findings are consistent with our previous\nreports.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
