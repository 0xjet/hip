    "plain_text": "# Incident Report\n\n**mimecast.com/incident-report/**\n\nPublished: March 16, 2021\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nIn January, we became aware of a security incident later determined to be conducted by the\nsame sophisticated threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds supply chain attack. During\nour investigation, we learned that the threat actor used the SolarWinds supply-chain\ncompromise to gain access to part of our production grid environment. Using this entry point,\nthe threat actor accessed certain Mimecast-issued certificates and related customer server\nconnection information. The threat actor also accessed a subset of email addresses and\nother contact information, as well as encrypted and/or hashed and salted credentials. In\naddition, the threat actor accessed and downloaded a limited number of our source code\nrepositories, but we found no evidence of any modifications to our source code nor do we\nbelieve there was any impact on our products. We have no evidence that the threat actor\n**accessed email or archive content held by us on behalf of our customers.**\n\nWhen we became aware of the security incident, we immediately launched an internal\ninvestigation. Our investigation was supported by leading third-party forensics and cyber\nincident response experts at Mandiant, a division of FireEye, and in coordination with law\nenforcement to aid their investigation into this threat actor. As the investigation progressed,\nwe issued a series of advisories to affected customers, including recommended\nprecautionary steps to mitigate risk.\n\nWe have now completed our forensic investigation with Mandiant and have eliminated the\nthreat actor’s access to our environment. We have already taken a number of actions to\nprevent future access to our environment as described below and we will continue to monitor\nfor threats and take precautionary steps as needed.\n\n**Incident Details and Remediation Actions**\n\nThe following provides a more detailed summary of our investigation, as well as an overview\nof the steps taken to address this attack and further enhance our environment.\n\n**Phase 1**\n\nIn January, Microsoft notified us that a certificate we provide to customers to authenticate\nMimecast Sync and Recover, Continuity Monitor, and IEP products to Microsoft 365\nExchange Web Services had been compromised by a threat actor they were actively\ninvestigating. Microsoft informed us that the threat actor used the certificate to connect to a\nlow single-digit number of our mutual customers’ M365 tenants from non-Mimecast IP\naddress ranges.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the evidence showed that this certificate was used to target only the small number of\ncustomers, we quickly formulated a plan to mitigate potential risk for all customers who used\nthe certificate. We made a new certificate connection available and advised these customers\nand relevant supporting partners, via email, in-app notifications, and outbound calls, to take\n[the precautionary step of switching to the new connection. Our public blog post provided](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-update-from-mimecast/)\nvisibility surrounding this stage of the incident.\n\nWe coordinated with Microsoft to confirm that there was no further unauthorized use of the\ncompromised Mimecast certificate and worked with our customers and partners to migrate to\nthe new certificate connection. Once a majority of our customers had implemented the new\ncertificate connection, Microsoft disabled the compromised certificate at our request.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\nSupported by Mandiant, we confirmed that the incident was related to the SolarWinds Orion\nsoftware compromise and was perpetrated by the same sophisticated threat actor. Our\ninvestigation determined that the initial intrusion resulted from SUNBURST malware, the\nbackdoor present in the compromised version of SolarWinds Orion software we had\npreviously used in our environment.\n\nOur investigation revealed suspicious activity within a segment of our production grid\nenvironment containing a small number of Windows servers. The lateral movement from the\n[initial access point to these servers is consistent with the mechanism described by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/20/deep-dive-into-the-solorigate-second-stage-activation-from-sunburst-to-teardrop-and-raindrop/)\nand other organizations that have documented the attack pattern of this threat actor. We\ndetermined that the threat actor leveraged our Windows environment to query, and\npotentially extract, certain encrypted service account credentials created by customers\nhosted in the United States and the United Kingdom. These credentials establish\nconnections from Mimecast tenants to on-premise and cloud services, which include LDAP,\nAzure Active Directory, Exchange Web Services, POP3 journaling, and SMTP-authenticated\ndelivery routes. We have no evidence that the threat actor accessed email or archive\n**content held by us on behalf of our customers.**\n\nAlthough we were not aware that any of the encrypted credentials were decrypted or\nmisused, we issued a specific advisory to customers hosted in the United States and United\nKingdom to take precautionary steps to reset their credentials. At this time, we published an\n[additional public blog post.](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-security-update/)\n\n**Phase 3**\n\nAs the investigation progressed, we determined that the threat actor had established\nadditional access methods to the same segment of our production grid environment. We\nremoved and blocked the threat actor’s means of access. All compromised systems were\nWindows-based and peripheral to the core of our production customer infrastructure. We\ncompletely replaced all compromised servers to eliminate the threat.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this point, we were able to determine the specific scope of data access and confirm\nexfiltration by the threat actor. We have no evidence that the threat actor accessed email\n**or archive content held by us on behalf of our customers. The threat actor did access a**\nsubset of email addresses and other contact information and hashed and salted credentials.\nSome of this information required us to notify the affected customers and partners under\ncertain regulations, which we have done. We are resetting the affected hashed and salted\ncredentials as a precautionary step.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the threat actor accessed and downloaded a limited number\nof our source code repositories, as the threat actor is reported to have done with other\nvictims of the SolarWinds Orion supply chain attack. We believe that the source code\ndownloaded by the threat actor was incomplete and would be insufficient to build and run\nany aspect of the Mimecast service. We found no evidence that the threat actor made any\nmodifications to our source code nor do we believe that there was any impact on our\nproducts. We will continue to analyze and monitor our source code to protect against\npotential misuse.\n\nIn March, we completed our forensic investigation with Mandiant.\n\n**Customer Impact**\n\nWe have no evidence that email or archive content was accessed by the threat actor.\nBeyond the low single-digit number of customers targeted by the threat actor, which we\n[contacted as described in our first blog post, we are not aware that any other](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-update-from-mimecast/)\ncustomers were actively targeted.\n[As described in our second blog post, we recommended that customers hosted in the](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-security-update/)\nUnited States and United Kingdom reset as a precautionary measure any server\nconnection credentials in use on the Mimecast platform.\nWe are resetting the affected hashed and salted credentials as a precautionary step.\nWe do not believe that the threat actor made any modifications to our source code.\nForensic analysis of all customer-deployed Mimecast software has confirmed that the\nbuild process of the Mimecast-distributed executables was not tampered with.\nThe threat actor accessed some information that required us to notify the affected\ncustomers and partners under certain regulations, which we have done.\n\n**Additional Mimecast Remediation Steps**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have completed the following actions:\n\nRotated all impacted certificates and encryption keys.\nUpgraded encryption algorithm strength for all stored credentials.\nImplemented enhanced monitoring of all stored certificates and encryption keys.\nDeployed additional host security monitoring functionality across all of our\ninfrastructure.\nDecommissioned SolarWinds Orion and replaced it with an alternative NetFlow\nmonitoring system.\nRotated all Mimecast employee, system, and administrative credentials, and\nexpanded hardware-based two-factor authentication for employee access to\nproduction systems.\nCompletely replaced all compromised servers.\nInspected and verified our build and automation systems to confirm that\nMimecast-distributed executables were not tampered with.\nImplemented additional static and security analysis across the source code tree.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new OAuth-based authentication and\nconnection mechanism between Mimecast and Microsoft technologies, which will\nprovide enhanced security to Mimecast Server Connections. We will work with\ncustomers to migrate them to this new architecture as soon as it is available.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis communication contains “forward-looking” statements, which are subject to the safe\nharbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal\nsecurities laws, that are based on currently available information and our current beliefs,\nexpectations and understanding.
