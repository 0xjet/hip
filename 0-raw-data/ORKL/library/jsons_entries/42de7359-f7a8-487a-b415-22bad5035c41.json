The team\npreviously made a post about how Sliver C2, XMRig CoinMiner, and Gh0st RAT were being\ndistributed through the Sunlogin RCE vulnerability. Additionally, since Gh0st RAT was\ndeveloped in China, it is the most common RAT used by threat actors based in China.\n\n[Sliver Malware With BYOVD Distributed Through Sunlogin Vulnerability Exploitations](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47088/)\n\nAweSun is also a remote control program developed in China and, while its specific\nvulnerability has not been identified, it is presumed that a similar RCE vulnerability to that of\nSunlogin had been disclosed. The same threat actors performed an RCE vulnerability\nexploitation on both Sunlogin and AweSun to install Sliver C2. A previous blog post has\ncovered the cases that later occurred where similar vulnerability exploitations were used to\ninstall the Paradise ransomware.\n\n[Paradise Ransomware Distributed Through AweSun Vulnerability Exploitation](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47590/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. PlugX\n\nPlugX is one of the major backdoors used by APT threat groups that are based in China. Its\ndistribution is known to have started in 2008 and is still being used to this day as variants\nwith additional features are being used for attacks. Mustang Panda, Winnti, APT3, and\nAPT41 are the main APT threat groups that have used PlugX in their attacks, and most of\n[them are known to be based in China. [1]](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\n\nPlugX is a module-based malware that supports various plugins with different features.\nTherefore, threat actors can perform malicious behaviors such as system control and\ninformation theft by using the various features from these plugins.\n\nAnother characteristic of PlugX is its use of the DLL side-loading method. The DLL sideloading method involves installing a malicious DLL in the same path as a normal program\nand using the execution of the normal program to load the malicious DLL, which in turn starts\nthe malicious routine. This is to evade being detected by security products. The normal\nprogram becomes the subject performing the malicious behaviors and these behaviors are\nthen recognized as the behaviors of a normal program.\n\nPlugX is usually distributed as a compressed file or a dropper, but, either way, the normal\nEXE file, the malicious loader DLL that’s going to be used for side-loading with the same\nfilename, and the encoded data files are ultimately created in the same directory. The\nexecutable file loads and executes the loader DLL in the same path, which in turn reads and\ndecrypts the data file in the same directory before executing it in the memory. After this\nprocess, the malware that is ultimately operating in the memory area is PlugX.\n\n## 2. PlugX Installed Through Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nASEC is monitoring attacks against systems with either unpatched vulnerabilities or\ninappropriately configured settings. Recently, the team confirmed that PlugX is being\ninstalled through the RCE vulnerability exploitation of Sunlogin and AweSun.\n\nAccording to AhnLab’s ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense) log, the team has confirmed that the\nPowerShell command executed via this vulnerability exploitation creates a file named\nesetservice.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Log of malware being downloaded through the vulnerability exploitation\nesetservice.exe is actually the HTTP Server Service program made by the company ESET,\nmeaning its a normal file.\n\nFigure 2. Downloaded HTTP Server Service program made by the company ESET\nFurther investigation into related logs revealed that the threat actor also downloaded a file\nnamed http_dll.dll aside from esetservice.exe. Additionally, the following is a log from another\nsystem that shows the threat actor not only exploited Sunlogin, but also the AweSun\nvulnerability in their attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Additionally downloaded malware\nDuring the process of investigating the connection between the two files, it was discovered\nthat the “esetservice.exe” program has a feature that loads the “http_dll.dll” file in the same\ndirectory if executed without an additional argument. This is a classic DLL side-loading\nmethod, and PlugX is most known for using this method.\n\nFigure 4. Routine\n\nthat loads the http_dll.dll file in the same directory\nPlugX is distributed with the normal exe program, the DLL that acts as the loader, and the\ndata file containing the actual encoded malware, as a set. An analysis of the actual code\nrevealed that the “http_dll.dll” file contains a routine to read the “lang.dat” file that is in the\nsame directory before decrypting and executing it.\n\n## 3. PlugX Dropper and Loader Analysis\n\nDuring the analysis of PlugX, malware using the same “esetservice.exe” and “http_dll.dll”\nfiles in their attack was found on VirusTotal. This malware is a WinRar Sfx format dropper\nmalware that creates “esetservice.exe,” “http_dll.dll,” and “lang.dat” upon execution. It then\nruns “esetservice.exe” to ultimately install and execute PlugX. While this dropper was not\nfound in the vulnerability exploitation covered above, considering that PlugX’s C&C address\nis the same as the download URL used in the vulnerability exploitation, it can be assumed\nthat the same threat actor is behind both attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PlugX dropper disguises itself as the path of normal programs and creates malware in\nthe “C:\\ProgramData\\Windows NT\\Windows eset service” path. They are also hidden\nthrough the properties setting to make them less noticeable by users.\n\nFigure 5. PlugX malware strains\n\ncreated in disguised path\nWhen “esetservice.exe” is executed, it loads the “http_dll.dll” file in the same directory, and\nconsequently executes the DllMain() function of “http_dll.dll”. Instead of directly executing the\nfunction for loading the “lang.dat” file, DllMain() modifies the code of “esetservice.exe,” as\nshown below, before applying a patch so that “esetservice.exe” loads “http_dll.dll” and\nbranches into the “http_dll.dll” loader routine itself.\n\nFigure 6. Code that has been patched to execute the loader function\nThis routine is responsible for loading the “lang.dat” file in the same directory and executing it\nin the memory. The beginning part of the “lang.dat” file is a shellcode. When this code is\nexecuted, it decrypts PlugX which has been saved with it and executes it in the memory.\n\nFigure 7. The lang.dat file holding a shellcode and the encoded PlugX\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4. Analysis of PlugX\n\nAs explained above, PlugX is a malware that has gone through continuous updates for more\nthan a decade, so all sorts of variants are being discovered even now. In 2020, a report\nabout the classification and analysis of various PlugX variants was published on\nDr.Web. **[[2] Security Joes covered the most recently discovered PlugX variants in 2022. The](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2020/july/Study_of_the_APT_attacks_on_state_institutions_in_Kazakhstan_and_Kyrgyzstan_en.pdf)**\nPlugX that is currently being analyzed is almost identical to the BackDoor.PlugX.38 variant\nthat was reported on Dr.Web. Excluding the configuration data, it can be assumed that it is\n[the same as the PlugX on the most recent Security Joes report. [3]](https://secjoes-reports.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Dissecting+PlugX+to+Extract+Its+Crown+Jewels.pdf)\n\nThe PlugX used in the attack offers various modes according to the argument given. The\nfollowing is a process tree that can be found when the PlugX that is currently being analyzed\nis executed. It can be inferred that the 4 modes, “100”, “200”, “201”, and “209” are executed\nin order.\n\nFigure 8. Process tree\nWhen the PlugX dropper is executed for the first time, it creates the files “esetservice.exe”,\n“http_dll.dll”, and “lang.dat” under the “%PUBLIC%\\Downloads\\” directory before executing\n“esetservice.exe”. After being loaded and executed by the “esetservice.exe” process, PlugX\nuses the create method of WMi’s Win32_Process class to give the argument “100” and\nexecute itself again.\n\nWhen executed after being given “100” as an argument, the UAC bypass process is started\nafter an injection process. “runonce.exe” is the process that is targeted and injected with a\nshellcode. The injected shellcode is responsible for abusing the ICMLuaUtil interface to\nbypass UAC and run the process with admin privileges. “esetservice.exe” is able to run with\nadmin privileges thanks to this. Afterward, it registers itself as a service and sets the\nargument to “200”. When the process reaches this point, it gives the “runonce.exe” process,\nwhich is the target of injection again, the argument “201” before executing and injecting itself.\n“runonce.exe” then gives the argument “209” to the “msiexec.exe” process responsible for\nplugins before executing and injecting it. The above procedure means that a different mode\nis executed according to the argument given. A summary of this is displayed below.\n\n**Argument** **Mode**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Argument** **Mode**\n\nNo argument Initial execution stage\n\n100 UAC bypassing stage\n\n200 Injection stage\n\n201 Main loop #1\n\n202 Main loop #2\n\n209 Plugin mode\n\n300 Auto-delete\n\nTable 1. Executable modes\nThe “lang.dat” holds the configuration data as well as the shellcode and the encoded PlugX.\nThe configuration data is also encoded, but it is decoded by the PlugX when it is executed in\norder to obtain the C&C address and other configuration information. There are 4 C&C\nserver addresses and they are shown below.\n\nFigure 9. Decrypted configuration data\n\ncdn.imango[.]ink:443\napi.imango[.]ink:443\napi.imango[.]ink:53\ncdn.imango[.]ink:53\n\n\n-----\n\nThe commands supported by PlugX are almost the same as the BackDoor.PlugX.38 version\ncovered on the Dr.Web report, but they are distinguished by the 2 additional commands,\nnamely the entries 0x0B and 0x0C.\n\n**Command** **Feature**\n\n0x01 Transmits collected information\n\n0x02 Request command again\n\n0x03 Plugin-related\n\n0x04 Reset connection\n\n0x05 Auto-delete\n\n0x06 Upload configuration data\n\n0x07 Update configuration data\n\n0x08 No actual purpose\n\n0x09 No actual purpose\n\n0x0A Pings port 53 from the transmitted address\n\n0x0B Download and execute files from an external source\n\n0x0C Start service\n\nTable 2. C&C commands\nThere are 2 additional plugins supported by PlugX in comparison to the previous\nBackDoor.PlugX.38 version, one that steals information saved to the clipboard and one that\nis responsible for RDP propagation. More information can be found in the Security Joes\nreport published in December 2022.\n\n\n**Plugin** **Date Time**\n**Stamp**\n\n\n**Feature**\n\n\nDisk 0x20120325 Tasks related to files (File lookup/reading/writing, process\nexecution, etc.)\n\nKeyLog 0x20120324 Keylogging\n\nNethood 0x20120215 Lookup shared network resource information\n\nNetstat 0x20120215 Lookup TCP/UDP connection tables and TCP entry settings\n\nOption 0x02120128 Workstation tasks\n\n\n-----\n\n**Plugin** **Date Time**\n**Stamp**\n\n\n**Feature**\n\n\nPortMap 0x02120325 Cannot recreate\n\nProcess 0x20120204 Lookup processes / modules.

Plugins supported by PlugX\nAdditionally, it is assumed that the location where the stolen data is saved differs for each\nmalware. For example, contrary to a past report, the stolen clipboard data is saved to the\n“clang.aif” file and the keylogging data in the “ksys.aif” file, both of which are in the\ninstallation directory.\n\nFigure 10. Files where the\n\nstolen clipboard and keylogging data are stored\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nRecently, there have been confirmed cases where various strains of malware were installed\non unpatched and vulnerable software. Although Sliver, Paradise ransomware, and\nCoinMiner are the malware that are typically installed through vulnerability exploitations, the\nteam has recently confirmed the distribution of the PlugX backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nPlugX is one of the main backdoor malware used by APT threat groups based in China. New\nfeatures are being added to it even to this day as it continues to see steady use in attacks.\nWhen the backdoor, PlugX, is installed, threat actors can gain control over the infected\nsystem without the knowledge of the user. In turn, this allows various malicious behaviors to\nbe performed such as logging key inputs, taking screenshots, and installing additional\nmalware.\n\nTherefore, users must update their installed software to the latest version to preemptively\nprevent vulnerability exploitations. Also, V3 should be updated to the latest version so that\nmalware infection can be prevented.\n\n**File Detection**\n\n– Malware/Win.Generic.C5387131 (2023.02.24.00)\n\n– Trojan/Win.Loader.C5345891 (2022.12.30.02)\n\n– Data/BIN.Plugx (2023.03.03.03)\n\n**Behavior Detection**\n\n– Malware/MDP.Download.M1197\n\n**IOC**\n\n**MD5**\n\n– 709303e2cf9511139fbb950538bac769\n\n– d1a06b95c1d7ceaa4dc4c8b85367d673\n\n– d973223b0329118de57055177d78817b\n\n**Download URLs**\n\n– hxxp://api.imango[.]ink:8089/http_dll.dll\n\n– hxxp://api.imango[.]ink:8089/esetservice.exe\n\n**C&C URLs**\n\n– cdn.imango[.]ink:443\n\n– api.imango[.]ink:443\n\n– api.imango[.]ink:53\n\n– cdn.imango[.]ink:53\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n[Tagged as:AweSun,exploit,PlugX,Sunlogin](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/awesun-en/)\n\n\n-----",
