This campaign is a typical example of the actor targeting South\nAsian government entities.\n\nThis campaign targets an elite unit of the Bangladesh's government with a themed lure\ndocument alleging to relate to the regular operational tasks in the victim's organization. The\nlure document is a spear-phishing email sent to high-ranking officers of the Rapid Action\nBattalion Unit of the Bangladesh police (RAB). The emails contain either a malicious RTF\ndocument or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet weaponized to exploit known vulnerabilities.\nOnce the victim opens the maldoc, the Equation Editor application is automatically launched\nto run the embedded objects containing the shellcode to exploit known vulnerabilities\n\n\n-----\n\ndescribed by CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802 — all in Microsoft\nOffice — then downloads the trojan from the hosting server and runs it on the victim's\nmachine. The trojan masquerades as a Windows Security update service and allows the\nmalicious actor to perform remote code execution, opening the door to other activities by\ninstalling other tools. In this campaign, the trojan runs itself but the actor has other RATs and\ndownloaders in their arsenal.\n\nSuch surveillance campaigns could allow the threat actors to access the organization's\nconfidential information and give their handlers an advantage over their competitors,\nregardless of whether they're state-sponsored.\n\n## Bitter threat actor\n\nBitter, also known as T-APT-17, is a suspected South Asian threat actor. They have been\nactive since 2013, targeting energy, engineering and government sectors in China, Pakistan\nand Saudi Arabia. In their latest campaign, they have extended their targeting to Bangladeshi\ngovernment entities.\n\nBitter is mainly motivated by espionage. The adversary typically downloads malware onto\ncompromised endpoints from their hosting server via HTTP and uses DNS to establish\ncontact with the command and control. Bitter is known for exploiting known vulnerabilities in\n[victims' environments. For example, in 2021, security researchers discovered that the](https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerability-in-desktop-window-manager-cve-2021-28310-used-in-the-wild/101898/)\nadversary was exploiting the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2021-28310, a security flaw in\nMicrosoft's Desktop Manager. Bitter is known to target both mobile and desktop platforms.\nTheir arsenal mainly contains Bitter RAT, Artra downloader, SlideRAT and AndroRAT.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe actor's infrastructure consists of the C2 server (helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com) and\nseveral domains that host the adversary's malware, which is outlined below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Domains hosting Bitter APT malware._\n\nThe SSL thumbprints are unique for each domain's certificate. We compiled a list of these\nSSL thumbprints in the IOCs section of the report. The timeline below shows the various\ndomains based on their certificate creation date.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 host is helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com. Its WhoIs record indicates that the domain\nautodefragapp[.]com registered it in November 2020, and later updated it on Nov. 3, 2021.\nWe have seen the actor use this C2 in previous campaigns.\n\nThe C2 domain resolved to 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 during the period of the campaign. This is a\n[legitimate IP address for the AWS Global Accelerator networking service. Usually, the AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/?blogs-global-accelerator.sort-by%3Ditem.additionalFields.createdDate%26blogs-global-accelerator.sort-order%3Ddesc%26aws-global-accelerator-wn.sort-by%3Ditem.additionalFields.postDateTime%26aws-global-accelerator-wn.sort-order%3Ddesc)\nGlobal Accelerator provides static IPs to the registrant, which allows the user to redirect\ntraffic to their application or host for improved performance. In this case, we believe that the\nactor is using the AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 host, which is\nparked behind the legitimate AWS service. We believe that the actor has employed this\ntechnique to conceal their identity.\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that this campaign is operated by Bitter based on the\nuse of the same C2 IP address from previous campaigns and similarities in the decrypted\nstrings of the payload, such as module names, payload executable name, paths and the\nconstants.\n\nThe 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 IP also hosts mswsceventlog[.]net, according to Cisco Umbrella, a\n[domain that was previously reported as Bitter's C2 server in a campaign against Pakistani](https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/259453)\ngovernment organizations.\n\n## The campaign\n\nCisco Talos observed an ongoing campaign operated by the Bitter APT group since August\n2021 targeting Bangladeshi government personnel with spear-phishing emails. The email\ncontains a maldoc attachment and masquerades as a legitimate email. The sender asks the\ntarget to review or verify the attached maldoc, which is either a call data record (CDR), a list\nof phone numbers, or a list of registered cases. We have seen the actor use these themes in\nphishing emails in the past.\n\nThe maldocs are an RTF document and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Examples of the\nspecific subjects of the phishing emails are below.\n\nSubject: CDR\nSubject: Application for CDR\nSubject: List of Numbers to be verified\nSubject: List of registered cases\n\nThe maldocs' file names are consistent with the phishing emails' themes, as seen in the list\nof file names below:\n\nPassport Fee Dues.xlsx\nList of Numbers to be verified.xlsx\n\n\n-----\n\nASP AVIJIT DAS.doc\nAddl SP Hafizur Rahman.doc\nAddl SP Hafizur Rahman.xlsx\nRegistered Cases List.xlsx\n\nBelow are two spear-phishing email samples of this campaign.\n\n_Phishing email sample 1_\n\n_Phishing email sample 2_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actor is using JavaMail with the Zimbra web client version 8.8.15_GA_4101 to send the\nemails. Zimbra is a collaborative software suite that includes an email server and a web\nclient for messaging.\n\n_Phishing email header information._\n\nThe originating IP address and header information indicates the emails were sent from mail\nservers based in Pakistan and the actor spoofed the sender details to make the email appear\nas though it was sent from Pakistani government organizations. The actor exploited a\npossible vulnerability in the Zimbra mail server. By modifying the Zimbra mail server\nconfiguration file, a user can send emails from a non-existing email account/domain. We\nhave compiled a list of fake sender email addresses from this campaign:\n\ncdrrab13bd@gmail[.]com\narc@desto[.]gov[.]pk\nso.dc@pc[.]gov[.]pk\nmem_psd@pc[.]gov[.]pk\nchief_pia@pc[.]gov[.]pk\nrab3tikatuly@gmail[.]com\nddscm2@pof[.]gov[.]pk\n\n## The infection chain\n\nThe infection chain begins with the spear-phishing email and either a malicious RTF\ndocument or an Excel spreadsheet attachment. When the victim opens the attachment, it\nlaunches the Microsoft Equation Editor application to execute the equations in the form of\nOLE objects and connects to the hosting server to download and run the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious RTF infection chain summary._\nIn the case of a malicious Excel spreadsheet, when the victim opens the file, it launches the\nMicrosoft Equation Editor application to execute the embedded equation object and launches\nthe task scheduler to configure two scheduled tasks. One of the scheduled tasks downloads\nthe trojan \"ZxxZ\" into the public user's account space, while the other task runs the \"ZxxZ\".\n\n_Malicious Excel infection chain summary._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload runs as a Windows security update service on the victim s machine and\nestablishes communication with the C2 to remotely download and execute files in the victim's\nenvironment.\n\n## RTF document\n\nThe Malicious RTF document is weaponized to exploit the stack overflow vulnerability CVE2017-11882, which enables arbitrary code execution on victims' machines running vulnerable\nversions of Microsoft Office. Our previous [blog outlines how this particular exploit works in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/10/old-dog-new-tricks-analysing-new-rtf_15.html)\nthe victim's environment.\n\n_Malicious RTF document sample._\nThe RTF document is embedded with an OLE object with the class name \"Equation 3.0.\" It\ncontains the shellcode as an equation formula created using Microsoft Equation Editor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Embedded Microsoft Equation object._\nWhen the victim opens the RTF file with Microsoft Word, it invokes the Equation Editor\napplication and executes the equation formula containing the Return-Oriented Programming\n(ROP) gadgets. The ROP loads and executes the shell code located at the end of the\nmaldocs in an encrypted format that connects to the malicious host olmajhnservice[.]com\nand downloads the payload from the URL hxxp[:]//olmajhnservice[.]/nxl/nx. The payload is\ndownloaded in the folder \"C:\\$Utf&quot created by the shellcode and runs as a process on\nthe victim's machine.\n\n_Download URL captured during runtime of the maldoc._\n\n## Excel spreadsheet\n\nThe malicious Excel spreadsheet is weaponized to exploit the Microsoft Office memory\ncorruption vulnerabilities CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802.\n\nWhen the victim opens the Excel spreadsheet, it launches the Microsoft Equation Editor\napplication to execute the embedded Microsoft Equation 3.0 objects.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious Excel spreadsheet._\n\nOnce the Microsoft Equation Editor service executes the embedded objects, it invokes the\nscheduled task service to configure the task scheduler with the commands shown below:\n\nTask 1: Rdx\n\nTask 2: RdxFac\n\nThe actor creates the folder \"RdxFact '' in the Windows tasks folder and schedules two tasks\nwith the task names \"Rdx '' and \"RdxFac '' to run every five minutes. When the first task runs,\nthe victim's machine attempts to connect to the hosting server through the URL and, using\nthe cURL utility, downloads the \"RdxFactory.exe\" into the public user profile's music folder.\nRdxFactory.exe is the trojan downloader.\n\nAfter five minutes of execution of the first task, \"Rdx,\", the second task, \"RdxFac,\"runs to\nstart the payload.\n\nBased on other related samples we discovered, the actor also uses different folder names,\ntasks names and dropper file names in their campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe noticed that the actor is using the cURL command-line utility to download the payload in\nthe Windows environment. Systems running Windows 10 and later have the cURL utility,\nwhich the actor abuses in this campaign.\n\n## The payload\n\nThe payload is a 32-bit Windows executable compiled in Visual C++ with a timestamp of\nSept. 10, 2021. We named the trojan \"ZxxZ\" based on the name of a separator that the\npayload uses while sending information to the C2. This trojan is a downloader that\ndownloads and executes the remote file. The executables were seen with the filenames\n\"Update.exe\", \"ntfsc.exe\" or \"nx\" in this campaign. They are either downloaded or dropped\ninto the victim's \"local application data\" folder and run as a Windows Security update with\nmedium integrity to elevate the privileges of a standard user.\n\nThe actor uses common encoding techniques to obfuscate strings in the WinMain function to\nhide its behavior from static analysis tools.\n\n_WinMain function snippet._\nThe decryption function receives the encrypted strings and decrypts each character with the\nXOR operation and stores the result in an array that will be returned to the caller function.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decryption function._\nThe malware searches for the Windows Defender and Kaspersky antivirus processes in the\nvictim's machine by creating the snapshot of running processes using\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot and iterates through each process using API Process32First and\nProcess32Next.\n\n\n-----\n\n_WinMain() snippet showing antivirus process detection._\nThe information-gathering function gathers the victim's hostname, operating system product\nname, and the victim's username and writes them into a memory buffer.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Information-gathering function._\nThe C2 communicating function at offset 401C50 is called from the two other requests\nmaking functions to send the victim's information with the decrypted strings\n\"xnb/dxagt5avbb2.php?txt=\" and \"data1.php?id=\" to C2 and receive the response.\n\nThe received response is a remote file saved into the \"debug\" folder and executed with the\nAPI \"ShellExecuteA\". In our research debugging environment, the remote file is similar to the\ntrojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Requests making function 2 at offset 00402130._\n\n## C2 communication\n\nFor C2 communication, first, the trojan sends the victim's computer name, user name, a\nseparator \"ZxxZ\" and the Windows version pulled from the registry. The server responds\nback with data in the format <id><user>:\"<Program name\">.\n\nNext, the malware requests the program data. The server sends back the data of the\nPortable Executable effectively matching the pattern:<zero or more bytes>ZxxZ<PE data\nminus the MZ>. It then saves the file to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Debug\\<program name>.exe\nand tries to execute it.\n\n_Request sent to C2._\nIf the download is successful, the server sends back the request with the opcode DN-S and,\nin case of a failure, the opcode RN_E in their response. Based on our analysis, the opdoce\nDN-S means \"download successful\" and RN_E stands for run error. If failed, the malware\nattempts to download the program data 225 times, and after that, it will launch itself and exit.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations should be vigilant about the highly motivated threat actors who are known to\nconduct targeted attacks in their region. Threat actors usually emerge with smart techniques\nto accomplish their adversarial objectives and we have seen such an attempt in this\ncampaign with the addition of a new variant to their arsenal.\n\nIn this current campaign, upon compromising the victim's machine and implanting the trojan\nZxxZ - which has remote file execution capability - the adversary can deploy and run other\ntools from their arsenal to achieve their malicious objective.\n\nOrganizations should have a layered defense strategy with the implementation of the latest\ndetection rules and behavioral protections in their endpoint defense solutions - not only with\ntechnical controls, but the organizations should have matured incident response plans and\nhave the organization's security posture streamlined to protect their environment against the\nlatest threats.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
