The attackers delivered a variety of lures to](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.netwire)\ntheir targets, predominantly posing as guides related to Indian governmental infrastructure and operations\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as Kavach and I.T.-related guides in the form of malicious Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) and\narchives (RARs, ZIPs) containing loaders for the RATs.\n\nApart from artifacts involved in the infection chains, we've also discovered the use of server-side scripts to\ncarry out operational tasks such as sending out malicious emails and maintaining presence on compromised\nsites via web shells. This provides additional insight into the attacker's operational TTPs.\n\n[Some of these lures and tactics utilized by the attackers bear a strong resemblance to the Transparent Tribe](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\n[and SideCopy APT groups, including the use of compromised websites and fake domains.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\n\n## How did it work?\n\nThis campaign uses a few distinct, yet simple, infection chains. Most infections use a maldoc that downloads\nand instruments a loader. The loader is responsible for downloading or decrypting (if embedded) the final\nRAT payload and deploying it on the infected endpoint. In some cases, we've observed the use of malicious\narchives containing a combination of maldocs, loaders and decoy images. The RAT payloads are relatively\nunmodified, with the command and control (C2) IPs and domains being the most pivotal configuration\ninformation.\n\n## So what?\n\nThis campaign illustrates another instance of a highly motivated threat actor using a set of commercial and\ncommodity RAT families to infect their victims. These RATs are packed with many features out-of-the-box to\nachieve comprehensive control over the infected systems. It is also highly likely that these malware families\nestablish footholds into the victim's networks to deploy additional plugins and modules.\n\n## Infection chains\n\nThe earliest instance of this campaign was observed in December 2020 utilizing malicious Microsoft Office\ndocuments (maldocs). These maldocs contain malicious VBA macros that download and execute the next\nstage of the infection — the malware loader.\n\nThe maldocs' content ranges from security advisories, to meeting schedules, to software installation notes.\nThese maldocs contain malicious macros that download and execute the next stage payload on the victim's\nendpoint. The final payload is usually a RAT that can perform a multitude of malicious operations on the\ninfected endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe maldocs pose as documents related to either meeting schedules pertinent to the victims, or as technical\nguides related to the Government of India's IT infrastructure. It is likely that these files are either delivered as\nattachments or links in spear-phishing emails where the verbiage is meant to social engineer the victims into\nopening the maldoc attachments or downloading them from an attacker-controlled link.\n\nSome file names used are:\n\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-1.docm\nSecurity-Updates.docm\nOnline meeting schedule for OPS.doc\nschedule2021.docm\n\nInterestingly, we've observed the use of Kavach-themed maldocs and binaries being used in recent\nSideCopy attacks.\n\nMalicious macro in maldoc downloading and executing the next stage payload.\n\n### Stage 2 — Loaders\n\nThe payload is usually loader binaries aimed at instrumenting the final malware payload. These loaders will\nuse either of the following techniques to instrument the final malware payloads on the endpoint:\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload payload from remote location and activate using process hollowing into itself or a target\nprocess.\nDecode embedded payload and activate using process hollowing.\n\nDepending on the variants, the loaders may also perform the following peripheral activities:\n\nDisable AMSI scanning by patching the first six bytes of the \"AmsiScanBuffer\" API.\nSet up persistence via registry for the next stage malware payload dropped to disk using the\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run keys.\n\n**Downloaders**\n\nThroughout March and April 2021, the attackers utilized downloaders to download and execute the RAT\npayloads from remote locations. The earliest versions of this loader used RunPE DLLs to inject the malware\npayloads into a specified target process via hollowing.\n\n.NET loader utilizing RunPE.dll to inject AveMaria RAT payload into InstallUtil.exe.\n\nIn May 2021, the attackers used the next iteration of their C#-based downloader that reaches out to a decoy\nURL and only proceeds with execution if the communication process fails.\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloader reaching out to a decoy URL and executing actual functionality in the catch code block.\n\nThis downloader then proceeds to patch the \"AmsiScanBuffer\" API, establishes persistence for the next\nstage payload and invokes it at the end. The payload in the next stage consists of legitimate .NET-based\napplications trojanized with the ability to decrypt and deploy the NetwireRAT malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAMSI bypass, persistence and invocation by the loader.\n\nToward the beginning of June 2021, the attackers started experimenting with the use of Pastebin as a\npayload-hosting platform. The downloader reached out to a Pastebin URL via cURL to download and inject\nthe payload into its own running process.\n\nEvolution of the downloaders:\n\n**Loaders with embedded payloads**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers modified open-source projects with code to load trojanized .NET-based binaries as loaders for\nthe RATs dating as far back as December 2020. One of the droppers we analyzed is based on the\n[Pangantucan Community High School library management system application.](https://github.com/bwjctan1999/PCHS-Library-Manager)\n\nIt is likely that the loader is based on a crypter available to the attackers since we've observed other\n[crimeware families such as Formbook use similar loaders to infect their targets.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.formbook)\n\nThe original application Initialization code for Form1.\n\nThe same function in the trojanized version calls a constructor to the added ISectionEntry class.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe loader modified the Login form with a call to a function that loads a DLL loader with the assembly name\n\"SimpleUI.\" The second-stage loader is extracted from the .NET resource with the name \"Draw.\"\n\nThe assembly extracted from the Draw resource is responsible for decoding and loading a Netwire injector\nmodule which is stored as the AuthorizationRule bitmap resource in the original trojanized loader.\n\nAutorizationRule blob parsed as a bitmap image (464,147 bytes long).\n\nThe injector is responsible for deploying the netwireRAT binary present in its .NET resources into a target\nprocess, such as vbc.exe.\n\n### Stage 3 — Final payloads\n\nThe Netwire and AveMaria RAT families are eventually downloaded and executed on the victim machine. In\nsome cases, we've also discovered the deployment of custom .NET-based file enumerator modules that\ngenerate and exfiltrate file path listings of specific file extensions on the infected systems.\n\n### Maldoc infection chain variation\n\nIn one instance, the attackers used a different variation of the infection chain that starts with a malicious\ndocument delivered to the victim. The macro in the maldoc downloads and executes a VBScript (VBS)\ninstead of directly downloading the malware payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe VBS contains many junk comments interlaced with the actual malicious code. The malicious code will\nexecute an encoded PowerShell command to download the next payload.\n\nThe PowerShell downloads a malicious archive and an unzip utility such as 7-Zip from a remote location.\nThis utility unzips and runs the malware payload from the archive file. An example of the command used to\nunzip the archive is:\n\n7za.exe x -y -aoa -bso0 -bse0 -bb0 -bd <archive_file_path>\n\nDecoded PowerShell commands to activate the next-stage payload.\n\nInfection chain diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final payload in this infection chain is a loader for AveMariaRAT.\n\n### Archive-based infections\n\nIn other infection attempts dating as far back as December 2020, the attackers hosted malicious ZIP\narchives containing malware payloads on compromised websites. It is likely that the URLs to these archive\nfiles were sent to victims to make them download and open the malware payload on their endpoints.\n\n\n-----\n\nThree distinct archives containing the malicious payloads.\n\nThe malicious binaries from the archives found thus far load and instrument NetwireRAT.\n\n## Payload Analysis\n\n### NetwireRAT\n\nNetwire is a highly versatile RAT consisting of multiple capabilities including:\n\nStealing credentials from browsers.\nExecute arbitrary commands.\nGather system information.\nFile management operations such as write, read, copy, delete files, etc.\nEnumerate, terminate processes.\nKeylogging.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwireRAT keylogger.\n\n### Ave Maria/WarzoneRAT\n\nAve MariaRAT, also known as WarzoneRAT, is a commercial RAT available for purchase to malicious\noperators although there are cracked versions of Warzone available online.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWarzoneRAT capabilities (snip) as advertised by its authors.\n\nLike Netwire, WarzoneRAT is also packed with a variety of functionalities including:\n\nRemote desktop.\nWebcam capture.\nCredential stealing from browsers and email clients.\nFile management operations such as write, read, copy, delete files etc.\nExecute arbitrary commands.\nKeylogging.\nReverse shells.\nEnumerate, terminate processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nReverse shell functionality in WarzoneRAT.\n\n### File enumerators\n\nApart from the two RATs, we've also observed specialized reconnaissance malware being deployed on the\nvictim's endpoints instead of a RAT family. The attackers deployed a preliminary recon tool to enumerate\nspecific folders looking for certain file extensions. The file listings/paths found are uploaded to an attackercontrolled C2 server.\n\nThe locations targeted were:\n\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\Downloads\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\Desktop\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\Documents\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\OneDrive\\Downloads\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\\nC:\\Users\\<current_user>\\OneDrive\\Documents\\\n\nThe file extensions searched for were:\n\n.txt, .doc, .dot, .wbk, .docx, .docm, .dotx, .dotm, .docb, .xls, .xlt, .xlm, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xltx, .xltm, .xlsb, .xla,\n.xlam, .xll, .xlw, .ppt, .pot, .pps, .pptx, .pptm, .potx, .potm, .ppam, .ppsx, .ppsm, .sldx, .sldm, .pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nFile enumerator malware module looking for specific file extensions.\n\n## Analyses and observations\n\n### Targeting\n\nAn extremely common theme of maldocs and archives discovered in this campaign refers to the Government\nof India's Kavach application. This is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application used by government\nemployees to access their emails. This theme has been used recently by the SideCopy APT's campaigns\ntargeting Indian government personnel, as well. Some of the malicious artifacts using the Kavach theme in\nthe current campaign are named:\n\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-1.docm\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER1.5.docm\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-VER-3.docm\nkavach-2-instructions.zip\nkavach-2-instructions.exe\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-V3.zip\nKAVACH-INSTALLATION-V3.exe\n\nOther file names indicating targeting of military and government personnel consist of:\n\nCONFD-PERS-Letter.docm\nPERS-CONFD-LETTER.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nAdmiral_Visit_Details_CONFD.exe\nPay and Allowance Details.xls\n\n**Compromised websites**\n\nThe attackers have relied on a combination of compromised websites and fake domains to carry out their\noperations — a tactic similar to that of the Transparent Tribe APT group. However, what stands out in this\ncampaign is the focus on compromising quasi-military or government-related websites to host malicious\npayloads. This might have been done to appear legitimate to victims and analysts.\n\nFor example, the attackers compromised and maintained access to a quasi-defense-related website\ndsoipalamvihar[.]co[.]in belonging to the Defence Services Officers' Institute (DSOI) using it to host\nnetwireRAT-related payloads since January 2021. In another instance, the attackers compromised the\nwebsite for the Army Public Schools of India (apsdigicamp[.]com) to host a variety of malicious archives\nserving NetwireRAT again.\n\nOn the other hand, the attackers used a fake domain govrn[.]xyz in July 2021 to host maldocs for their\ninfection chains.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious scripts and payloads hosted on a compromised website.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe compromised websites were used heavily to host artifacts from maldocs to RATs. However, these\nwebsites hosted a few other malicious artifacts as well. The artifacts scripts were used as:\n\nEmailers.\nWeb shells.\n[CSRF PoC generator.](https://github.com/merttasci/csrf-poc-generator)\nFile uploaders.\n\nNone of these scripts have been written from scratch or customized heavily by the attackers. This practise is\nin sync with their RAT deployments — neither the RAT payloads nor the infrastructure scripts have been\nmodified except their configurations. The actual effort instead is put into social engineering and infecting\nvictims.\n\n**Proliferation through emails**\n\nA variety of mailers have been used by the attackers to proliferate the maldocs, archives and download links:\n\nTeamCC ninjaMailer v1.3.3.7\nLeaf PHPMailer 2.7\nLeaf PHPMailer 2.8\n\nThese PHP-based scripts are capable of configuring SMTP options and generating spear-phishing emails\nthat can be distributed to victims with malicious payloads or links.\n\n\n-----\n\nTeamCC NinjaMailer hosted by the attackers on one of the compromised sites.\n\n**Administration**\n\nThe attackers utilized two types of management scripts to administer the compromised websites. PHP and\nPerl-based web shells maintain browser-based access to the sites and perform administrative actions such\nas file management, process management and viewing file contents. The web shells used are:\n\nPhpSpy\nb374k 2.7\nOlder b374k web shell\n\nb374k web shell's login page on the compromised site.\n\n\n-----\n\nOlder Perl-based b374k web shell hosted on a compromised site.\n\nThe attackers also deployed a file uploader utility (created by \"Pakistan Haxors Crew\") to upload files to the\nsites without having to go through the web shells.\n\nFile uploader\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis campaign has been ongoing since the end of 2020 and continues to operate today. The attackers\ninitially deployed Netwire and Warzone RATs on the infected endpoints. The use of these RATs benefits an\nadversary twofold — it makes attribution difficult and saves the effort to create bespoke implants. Beginning\nin July 2021, however, we observed the deployment of the file enumerators alongside the RATs. This\nindicates that the attackers are expanding their malware arsenal to target their victims: military and\ngovernment personnel in India.\n\nInfection tactics including government-themed lures, deployment of commodity/commercial RATs and file\nenumerators and the use of compromised and attacker-owned domains indicates a strong resemblance to\nSideCopy and Transparent Tribe.\n\nUnlike many crimeware and APT attacks, this campaign uses relatively simple, straightforward infection\nchains. The attackers have not developed bespoke malware or infrastructure management scripts to carry\nout their attacks, but the use of prebaked artifacts doesn't diminish the lethality of these attacks. In fact,\nready-made artifacts such as commodity or cracked RATs and mailers allow the attackers to rapidly\noperationalize new campaigns while focusing on their key tactic: tricking victims into infecting themselves.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[malware detailed in this post.
