Since they first emerged back in 2007 with a series of\ncyberespionage attacks against the South Korean government, these threat actors have\nsuccessfully managed to pull off some of the most notable and devastating targeted attacks\n[—such as the widely-reported 2014 Sony hack and the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/the-hack-of-sony-pictures-what-you-need-to-know) [2016 attack on a Bangladeshi bank](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/what-we-can-learn-from-the-bangladesh-central-bank-cyber-heist/)\n[—in recent history. Throughout the Lazarus group's operational history, few threat actors](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-look-into-the-lazarus-groups-operations)\nhave managed to match the group in terms of both scale and impact, due in large part to the\nwide variety of tools and tactics at the group’s disposal.\n\nThe malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus’ arsenal. This\n[malicious software, which could have been active since late 2016, was used in a recent](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\n[campaign targeting financial institutions using watering hole attacks. The variant used during](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101)\n[these attacks (TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/TROJ_RATANKBA.A)\nand software targeting banking systems. We analyzed a new RATANKBA variant\n(BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL-A), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script\ninstead of its more traditional PE executable form—a version that other researchers also\nrecently identified.\n\nWe identified a number of servers Lazarus used as a backend system for temporarily holding\nstolen data. We were able to access this backend, which provided us with valuable\ninformation about this attack and its victims.\n\nAround 55% of the victims of RATANKBA’s Powershell version were located in India and\nneighboring countries. This implies that the Lazarus group could be is either collecting\nintelligence about targets in this region, or is at an early stage of planning. They could have\nalso been performing exercises in preparation for an attack against similar targets.\n\nThe majority of the observed victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoft\nsoftware. Less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users, which\nmeans that currently, RATANKBA mostly affects smaller organizations or individual users, not\nlarger organizations. It's possible that Lazarus is using tools other than RATANKBA to target\nlarger organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus backend logs also record victim IP addresses. Based on a reverse WHOIS lookup,\nnone of the victims can be associated with a large bank or a financial institution. However,\nwe did manage to identify victims that are likely employees of three web software\ndevelopment companies in India and one in South Korea.\n\n**Infection Flow**\n\n_Figure 1. RATANKBA Infection Flow_\n\nRATANKBA is delivered to its victims using a variety of lure documents, including Microsoft\nOffice documents, malicious CHM files, and different script downloaders. These documents\ncontain topics discussing either software development or digital currencies. The growth of\ncryptocurrencies may be a driving force behind the use of cryptocurrency-related lures.\n\nAn example of a lure used in a RATANKBA attack can be seen below:\n\n_Figure 2. Malicious CHM file used as RATANKBA lure_\n\nOnce the lure’s recipient opens and executes the file, a backdoor will be dropped into the\nvictim’s system. This RATANKBA backdoor is what is used to communicate with\nRATANKBA’s Command-and-Control (C&C) server. We have observed two initial\nconversations with the C&C server (all are done via HTTP GET or POST to the server):\n\nHTTP POST to {script}.jsp?action=BaseInfo&u=XXX: Sends the victim information to\nthe backend server\nHTTP GET to {script}.jsp?action=What&u=XXX: Checks if there are any pending jobs\nfor the backdoor\n\nThis means that the backdoor is responsible for both uploading victim information, as well as\nexecuting any tasks that the controller has assigned to it, which includes the following:\n\nKillkill: Stops the backdoor’s activities\ninterval: Changes the interval in which the backdoor retrieves jobs; the default interval\nis set at 120 seconds\ncmd: Executes shell commands\nexe:Reflectively injects a DLL downloaded from a specific URL\n\nIn addition to the backdoor’s modus operandi, the attackers will use a Microsoft WMI\ncommand-line tool to list the compromised system’s running processes, which are sent to the\nC&C server:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe” /c “wmic process get\nprocessid commandline sessionid | findstr SysWOW”\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wmic process get\nprocessid,commandline,sessionid | findstr x86”\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nDuring our analysis, we collected a copy of the RATANKBA malware’s Lazarus Remote\nController tool. The remote controller provides a user interface that allows attackers to send\njobs to any compromised endpoint. The controller gives the attackers the ability to\nmanipulate the victims’ host by queueing tasks on the main server. RATANKBA retrieves and\nexecutes the tasks, and retrieves the collected information.\n\n_Figure 3. RATANKBA communication diagram_\n\nThe RATANKBA malware has a control model that does not use real-time communication\nbetween the backdoor and the attacker. Instead, both the remote controller and the backdoor\nconnect to its main communication control server to push or pull pieces of information. The\ncontroller uses a graphical UI interface and can be used to push code to the server, while the\nbackdoor regularly connects to the server to check for pending tasks. The controller\ndownloads the victim profiles from the server. If the profiles are already downloaded by the\ncontroller, they are deleted from the server side. The controller can post victim-specific tasks\nas well as global specific tasks to the server. Below are the various functionalities of\nRATANKBA’s controller:\n\n**Command Name** **Function**\n\n_get_time_ Retrieves the server time\n\n_delete_inf_ Deletes the downloaded victim profiles\n\n_delete_con_ Deletes the connection log files if they were already downloaded\n\n_Kill:_ Posts a job to kill the backdoor\n\n_inject_ Posts a job for DLL injection\n\n_Interval_ Changes the sleep interval\n\n_Cmd_ Posts a job for command shell execution\n\n_delete_cmd_ Retrieves the job results and deletes the posted job\n\n_broadcast_cmd:_ Posts a job for all the backdoors connecting to the server\n\n_Figure 4. RATANKBA main console interface_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. RATANKBA host manipulation console_\n\nRATANKBA’s controllers use the “Nimo Software HTTP Retriever 1.0” user-agent string for\nits communication. The communication protocol format for the controller and backdoor is as\nfollows:\n\n   - <domain>/<jsp filename>.jsp?action=<corresponding actions plus additional needed\nparameters>`\n\nOne of most notable changes on the new RATANKBA variant is that the new version was\nwritten in Powershell, whereas the original variant was in PE form. The shift from PE to\nPowershell makes it more difficult for antivirus solutions to detect. The screenshot below\nshows the conversion from C/C++ code to Powershell, while the protocol remained\nunchanged.\n\n_Figure 6. C/C++ version of RATANKBA_\n\n_Figure 7. Powershell version of RATANKBA_\n\n**Profile of the Attackers**\n\nWhile we do not have any knowledge of who the actual Lazarus attackers are, the data\ncollected from the backend systems gives us some insights into the internet usage patterns\nof systems likely owned by Lazarus group members. Clues regarding the profiles of the\nattackers was also found, including those connected to developers and at least one operator.\nAll of them appear to be native Korean speakers, or at least have Korean language\nproficiency that is at the near-native level. We believe at least one of them also understands\nChinese.\n\nWe also observed clues that the attackers are interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin\n(BTC) and Ant Share (NEO). One of them transferred shares of NEO at a good market price.\n\n_Figure 8. Empty cryptocurrency wallet of the attacker_\n\n_Figure 9. An attacker transfers 594 NEO to another wallet, with the money going to a mixer_\n\n_Figure 10. An attacker mining Ant Share_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Defending against RATANKBA**\n\nGiven Lazarus’ use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it’s\nreasonable to assume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their\nmalicious activities. Overall, an organization will need multilayered security strategies, as\nLazarus and other similar groups are experienced cybercriminals who employ different\nstrategies to get past organizational defenses.\n\nThe impact of this malware can be mitigated with proven mitigation techniques such as\nroutinely scanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from\nentering and spreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other\n[key people in an organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/keep-an-eye-out-for-these-social-engineering-scams)\nwhat to look out for when it comes to malicious attacks.\n\nOther mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s\n[perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help](http://blog.trendmicro.com/ensuring-comprehensive-endpoint-security/)\nprevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.\n\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Security™ provides virtual patching that protects endpoints from threats](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/deep-security.html)\nsuch as malicious redirections to malware-hosting URLs as well as those that exploit\n[unpatched vulnerabilities.
