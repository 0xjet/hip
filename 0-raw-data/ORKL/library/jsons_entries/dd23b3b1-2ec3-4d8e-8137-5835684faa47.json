Further investigation\nrevealed this campaign was a part of a long-running activity targeting other Central-Asia countries, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, since\nat least 2014.\n\n[The actor suspected of this cyber-espionage operation is an APT group dubbed “IndigoZebra“, previously attributed by researchers to China.](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332)\nThe technical details of the operation were not publicly disclosed before.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the tools, TTPs and infrastructure used by the attacker during the years of its activity. We will also provide\ntechnical analysis of the two different strains of the previously publicly undescribed backdoor xCaon, including its latest version we dubbed\n**BoxCaon which uses the legitimate cloud-storage service Dropbox to act as its Command and Control server.**\n\n## Infection Chain\n\nOur investigation started with the emails sent from an employee of the Administrative Office of the President in Afghanistan to the\nemployees of the Afghanistan National Security Council (NSC). The email asked the recipient to review the modifications in the document\nrelated to the upcoming press conference of the NSC.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 1: Malicious email sent to the Afghan government employees**\n\nThe email contains a password-protected RAR archive named `NSC Press conference.rar . Extracting the archive with the password`\nprovided in the email requires user interaction and therefore provides a challenge for some sandbox security solutions.\n\n**Fig 2: The infection chain**\n\nThe extracted file, `NSC Press conference.exe, acts as a dropper. The content of the lure email suggests that the attached file is the`\ndocument, hence, to reduce the suspicion of the victim running the executable, the attackers use the simple trick – the first document on the\nvictim’s desktop is opened for the user upon the dropper execution.\n\nWhether the dropper found a document to open or not, it will proceed to the next stage – drop the backdoor to\n```\nC:\\users\\public\\spools.exe and execute it.\n\n## BoxCaon Backdoor Analysis\n\n```\nThe backdoor contain narrow capabilities: download and upload files, run commands and send the attackers the results. However short the\nlist, they allow the attackers to upload and execute additional tools for further reconnaissance and lateral movement.\n\nTo hide malicious functionality – persistence and C&C communication – from static detections, the malware uses a common obfuscation\ntechnique known as “stackstrings” to build wide char strings.\n\n## Dropbox as a C&C Server\n\nThe backdoor utilizes Dropbox as a C&C server, by sending and receiving commands written to a specific folder in a specially created Dropbox\naccount, prepared by the attacker before the operation. By using the legitimate Dropbox service for C&C communications, instead of regular\ndedicated server infrastructure, aids in masking the malicious traffic in the target’s network, as no communication to abnormal websites is\n\n\n-----\n\nta g p ace e bac doo uses t e opbo t a a dcoded bea e access to e a d as t e ab ty to do oad, up oad, a d e ecute\nfiles.\n\nIn the initialization stage, the backdoor creates a unique folder for the victim in an attacker-controlled Dropbox account. The folder is named by\nthe victim’s MAC address which is obtained using `GetAdaptersInfo API.`\n\n**Fig 3: Creation of a folder in Dropbox by the backdoor and stackstrings obfuscation**\n\nLocally, the backdoor creates a working folder at `C:\\users\\public\\<d> (where` `<d> is a random integer). It then proceeds by uploading`\ntwo files to the server:\n```\n   m-<date>.txt – containing the backdoor execution path\n   d-<date>.txt – containing the local working folder path.\n\n```\n**Fig 4: File upload to Dropbox by the backdoor**\n\nWhen the attackers need to send a file or command to the victim machine, they place them to the folder named `d in the victim’s Dropbox`\nfolder. The malware retrieves this folder and downloads all its contents to the working folder. Finally, if the file named `c.txt – that contains`\nthe attacker command, exists in this working folder, the backdoor executes it using the `ComSpec environment variable, which normally points`\nto the command line interpreter (like `cmd.exe ), and uploads the results back to the Dropbox drive while deleting the command from the`\nserver.\n\n## Persistence\n\nThe backdoor establishes persistence by setting the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows`\n```\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\load registry key to point to its executable. This method is less common than Run or RunOnce keys but\n\n```\nachieves its ultimate goal: the program listed in the `Load registry value runs when any user logs on.`\n\n## Post-infection\n\n\n-----\n\nO ce t e C&C co u cat o s estab s ed, t e t eat acto sta ts by e ecut g ge p t g a d eco a ssa ce co a ds o t e\nmachine. In this attack, some of the actions we spotted included:\n\nDownload and execution of `ntbscan (SHA-1:` `90da10004c8f6fafdaa2cf18922670a745564f45 ) – NetBIOS scanner tool widely used`\nby multiple APT actor including the prolific Chinese group APT10\nExecution of Windows built-in networking utility tools\nAccess to the victim’s files, especially documents located on the Desktop\n\n## Attribution\n\nSearching for related samples in the wild yielded almost 30 executables, each of them bear varying degrees of similarity with the `spools.exe`\n**BoxCaon backdoor.**\n\nOne of the common similarities is a very specific implementation of the command execution: first constructing the `ComSpec string on stack,`\nusing the same path naming convention for the output file, and deleting it right after the execution:\n\n**Fig 5: Code similarities between BoxCaon (left) and Investigating China’s Crimes against Humanity.exe**\n**(sha1:3557d162828baab78f2a7af36651a3f46d16c1cb)**\n\nThe earliest of the found samples is dated back to 2014. Even though some of the executables claim to be compiled in 2004 or 2008, based on\nthe C&C servers registration time and the activity, we believe the compilation date was probably modified by the actor.\n\n[While we were collecting additional information about this long-lasting operation, we noticed a reference to the](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5989e1e2104ee777266a4695) Kaspersky 2017 APT trends\nreport where one of the samples is referred to as xCaon malware, used by the Chinese-speaking APT actor “IndigoZebra“. The other\nsamples in our set appear to be the different variants of xCaon, including packed ones, or the PoisonIvy malware which was also reported as\na part of the actor’s arsenal.\n\nBased on the code and functionality similarities we can attribute the BoxCaon backdoor to the updated variant of the same xCaon family\n(hence the name). It is the only xCaon version that communicates over Dropbox API in clear text commands, whereas all the other samples\nuse HTTP protocol with Base64+XOR encryption to communicate with their C&C servers. Although the xCaon malware family is used in the\nwild for several years, there was no technical analysis publicly available until now. In the next section, we will summarize the technical details\nof all the versions we’ve encountered.\n\n\n-----\n\n## xCaon HTTP variant analysis\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we found an approximate of 30 different samples of the xCaon HTTP variant with slightly different functionality. Below we\nwill cover the most note-worthy features of the backdoor, highlighting samples with unique functionality.\n\n## Anti-AV\n\nThe HTTP variant checks if Kaspersky is installed on the victim’s machine by searching for the existence of files in the Kaspersky installation\nfolder.\n\n**Fig 6: Backdoor searches for files in the installation directory of Kaspersky AV**\n\nIf Kaspersky AV is not installed on the system, persistence via registry is installed. First, the backdoor makes sure that a copy of the\nexecutable exists in the specific path of the `TEMP folder, and then the path is written to the`\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\load key, causing the malware to run each time any\n\n```\nuser logs in.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 7: Backdoor establishes persistence via Load registry if Kaspersky is not installed**\n\n## Command Execution\n\nThe backdoor receives commands from the attacker and runs them in an interactive CMD shell using pipes. The commands may differ\nbetween the samples, the full list of the commands is provided in [Appendix B].\n\n**Fig 8: Interactive CMD shell using pipes**\n\n## Victim Fingerprinting\n\nThe backdoor collects the victim’s MAC address using the `GetAdaptersInfo API. Some of the versions generate a user ID and save it in a`\ntemporary file. These IDs are then passed to the C&C server as one of the POST body parameters (MAC address is sent encrypted as\ndiscussed later).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 9: Generate a user ID and save it in a temp file**\n\n## C&C Communication Protocol\n\nThe communication between the malware and the server is based on the HTTP protocol and slightly varies between the samples. Every few\nseconds the backdoor sends a POST request to the C&C URL. In the response (which looks like an HTML page), the malware searches for a\nspecific pattern: it takes the string between `<!—|# and` `#|->, decodes it, and executes the command. The result is encrypted and sent`\nback to another URL on the server as the parameter of a POST request.\n\n**Fig 10: C&C communication**\n\n## Encryption\n\nThe HTTP variant used an interesting and unique method of encryption for both configuration and communication. It uses a predefined key,\nwhich we found to be one of the following two (depends on the malware variant):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n\"GetMessagePos SendMessage GetExitCodeProces CreateProcess GetTickCount GetDCEx CopyImage DrawText CloseHandle\nSendMessageTimeout\"\n\n```\n2.\n```\n\"\\x32\\xE2\\x5C\\x48\\xEC\\x0E\\xC3\\x7F\\x5F\\x7A\\xED\\x11\\xCB\\xE5\\x0A\\x87\\x0F\\xFA\\x7D\\xFC\\xF9\\xA7\\x39\\x38\\x3D\\xE3\\x6B\\x6F\\xBF\\x\n\n```\nThe decryption process is based on splitting the “fake” base64-like string into two strings, XORing the first part with the predefined key,\nbase64-decoding the second part, and finally, XOR both the results.\n\n## Targets\n\n**Fig 11: Targeted region**\n\nWhile we saw the Dropbox variant (BoxCaon) targeting Afghan government officials, the HTTP variants are focused on political entities in two\nparticular Central Asian countries – Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThis very specific victimology is based upon the following overlapping indicators:\n\nCheck Point products’ telemetry\nC&C domains impersonating known Uzbek and Kyrgyz domains ( post[.]mfa-uz[.]com – Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs;\n```\n   ousync[.]kginfocom[.]com – Kyrgyz state enterprise “Infocom”)\n\n```\n– malware names of the samples were written in Kyrgyz and Russian ( Министрге сунуштама.exe – `Recommendation to the`\n```\n   Minister.exe in Kyrgyz; материалы к массовому беспорядку.exe – materials to riots.exe in non-native Russian )\n\n```\nVT submitters’ countries for multiple samples from this campaign are Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAs the Dropbox variant uses Dropbox API for communication, the only information we were able to gather from it is the Dropbox account\ninformation [Appendix C].\n\nHowever, when we analyzed the infrastructure of the HTTP variants, we saw that the samples have a common infrastructure for over 6 years\nsince the first sample was in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 12: HTTP Variant Infrastructure Graph**\n\nTo get a clearer picture of how the attackers operated their infrastructure throughout the years, we have plotted the various malicious domains\naccording to the ASN they were hosted on. The results are presented in the figure below:\n\n**Fig 13: Correlation between domains and ASNs over time**\n\n**Few observations:**\n\nMost of the domains are relatively short-lived. This can be explained by the precision targeting of the whole operation: the lookalike\ndomains were most likely created to mislead a specific entity and were not reused anymore.\nSince 2019, all of the new infrastructure has been concentrated on ASN 20473 (CHOOPA). This observation does not come as a\nsurprise: Vultr, a subsidiary of CHOOPA, is [considered an “attractive platform for criminals” by the research community and widely used](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting)\n[for malicious purposes by multiple groups including, for example, Chinese-based APT group ViciousPanda whose recent C&C servers](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign)\nare also all hosted on Vultr servers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this publication we unveiled the latest activity and tools of the long-running IndigoZebra operation, previously attributed to a Chinesespeaking threat actor.\n\nIn this case, we observed a cyber-espionage operation focusing on governmental agencies in Central Asia, being targeted with the Poison Ivy\nand xCaon backdoors, along with the newly discovered BoxCaon backdoor variant – whose C&C communication capability was updated to\nutilize the Dropbox service itself as the C&C infrastructure of the operation.\n\nWhile the IndigoZebra actor was initially observed targeting former Soviet republics such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, we have now\nwitnessed that its campaigns do not dial down, but on the contrary – they expand to the new targets in the region, with a new toolset.\n\n\n-----\n\nC ec [o t p oducts b oc t s attac](https://www.checkpoint.com/infinity-vision/zero-day-protection/) o t e e y st step\n\n## Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise\n\n**BoxCaon**\n```\nb9973b6f9f15e6b20ba1c923540a3c9b\n974201f7895967bff0b018b95d5f5f4b\n\n```\n**xCaon**\n```\n3ecfc67294923acdf6bd018a73f6c590\n35caae29c47dfb570773f6d5fd37e625\n3562bf97997c54d74f58d4c1ad84fcea\nc00f6268075e3af85176bf0b00c66c13\n85ea346e74c120c83db7a89531f9d9a1\n5a8783783472be67c09926cc139d5b27\nb3d11e570da4a66f4b8520bc6107283b\nfdcae752f64245c159ab0f4d585c5bf8\nbb521918d08a4480699e673554d7072c\nc5406e7e161c758e863eb63001861bb1\n4d6e93d2416898ea3a4f419aa3a438e3\n6dfd06f91060e421320b6ebd63c957f0\n0b10ac9bf6d2d31cbce06b09f9b0ae75\nb831a48e96e2f033d09d7ad5edd1dc67\na875112c66da104c35d0eb43385d7094\n1a28c673b2b481ba53e31f77a27669e7\nef3383809fdf5a895b42e02bf06f5aa3\naa107be86814d9c86911a2a7874d38a0\n45d8cfe3450562564a1eb00a1aa0db83\ncdd7bfa36c6e47730fad94113aba7070\n06d72a4d99fcd76a3502432657f3c999\n5a91ccabd2b12ac56ba5170cf9ff8343\n33f42e9678ee91369d11ef344bbd5a0d\n84575619a690d3ef1209b7e3a7e79935\n16e61624827d7785740b17c771a052e6\nccc7f88b72c286fd756e76309022e9f8\ne98031cf43bfed73db0bce43918a608c\n5ea42089cf91464b9c0c42292c18ba4c\ncff6d9f5d214e3366d6b4ae31c413adc\n\n```\n**PoisonIvy**\n```\nc74711de8aa68e7d97f501eda328d032\n\n```\n**C&C servers**\n\nDomain URL\n\ninfodocs[.]kginfocom[.]com infodocs[.]kginfocom[.]com/gin/kw.asp\n\ninfodocs[.]kginfocom[.]com/gin/tab.asp\n\nousync[.]kginfocom[.]com ousync[.]kginfocom[.]com/sync/kw.asp\n\nuslugi[.]mahallafond[.]com uslugi[.]mahallafond[.]com/hall/kw.asp\n\n6z98os[.]id597[.]link 6z98os[.]id597[.]link/css/art.asp\n\nhwyigd[.]laccessal[.]org hwyigd[.]laccessal[.]org/news/art.asp\n\nhwyigd[.]laccessal[.]org/news/js.asp\n\nhelp[.]2019mfa[.]com help[.]2019mfa[.]com/help/art.asp\n\nm[.]usascd[.]com m[.]usascd[.]com/uss/word.asp\n\nns01-mfa[.]ungov[.]org ns01-mfa[.]ungov[.]org/un/art.asp\n\n\n-----\n\ndcc[.]ungov[.]org dcc[.]ungov[.]org/crss/art.asp\n\nindex[.]google-upgrade[.]com index[.]google-upgrade[.]com/upgrade/art.asp\n\nmofa[.]ungov[.]org mofa[.]ungov[.]org/momo/art.asp\n\nupdate[.]ictdp[.]com update[.]ictdp[.]com/new/art.asp\n\npost[.]mfa-uz[.]com post[.]mfa-uz[.]com/post/art.asp\n\ncdn[.]muincxoil[.]com cdn[.]muincxoil[.]com/cdn/js.asp\n\ncdn[.]muincxoil[.]com/cdn/art.asp\n\ntm[.]2019mfa[.]com tm[.]2019mfa[.]com/css/p_d.asp\n\n## Appendix B: HTTP variant commands list\n\nCommand Action\n\nx-<#B#> Create BAT file on the victim’s machine\n\nx-<#U#> Upload file to the victim’s machine\n\nx-Down Download a file to the victim’s machine from a URL and execute it\n\nx-StartIM Start interactive shell\n\nx-Unis Exit the process (uninstall)\n\nx-Delay Sleep for X seconds\n\nx-Exec Execute a file\n\nx-DownOnly Download a file to the victim’s machine from a URL\n\n## Appendix C: Dropbox account information\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix D: MITRE ATT&CK Matrix\n\nTactic Technique Technique name\n\nInitial Access T1566.001 Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n\nExecution T1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File\n\nPersistence T1547.001 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nDiscovery T1518.001 Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery\n\nCommand and Control T1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols\n\nT1102.002 Web Service: Bidirectional Communication\n\nT1132 Data encoding\n\nExfiltration T1567.002 Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\n\n\n-----",
