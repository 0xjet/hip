This data\nincludes all account information such as billing addresses, phone numbers, and credit card\ninformation.\n\n\"The personal information was compromised when it was being entered into the site and\nincludes full name, billing address, email address, password, telephone number and\npayment card information, including card number, expiry date and CVV,\" stated the [advisory.](https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/customer-data-theft)\n\nVisionDirect stated that Paypal payment credentials would not have been stolen.\n\nThis attack only affected visitors who logged into their accounts and entered or updated their\naccount information during the affected period. Users who simply visited the site or used\nstore billing information would not have been affected.\n\nVisionDirect said they will be contacting all affected customers in the next few days.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Compromise was caused by MageCart script\n\nThis data breach was caused by a MageCart attack, which is when attackers add malicious\nJavaScript to a site that captures payment and account information when it is entered into a\nform or submitted.\n\nIn this particular attack, a script was added various VisionDirect domains that pretended to\nbe Google Analytics.\n\nThat's exactly what it was. The data was stolen via a fake Google Analytics script:\nhttps://g-analytics[.]com/libs/1.0.16/analytics.js – you can view a copy of the JS via the\n[@urlscanio archive of](https://twitter.com/urlscanio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [https://t.co/TV22dxvCcK](https://t.co/TV22dxvCcK) [https://t.co/SFi5Wp4gm3](https://t.co/SFi5Wp4gm3)\n[pic.twitter.com/rY13cMR2TL](https://t.co/rY13cMR2TL)\n\n[— Bad Packets Report (@bad_packets) November 18, 2018](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1064077688938229760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWhile the script looks very similar to the normal Google Analytics code, the domain ganalytics[.]com is not actually owned by Google. Instead this domain is owned by the\nattackers who use it to store the stolen credit card and account information.\n\n**Malicious script on VisionDirect pretending to be Google Analytics**\n[Security researcher Willem de Groot told BleepingComputer that he had discovered this](https://twitter.com/gwillem)\ndomain being used in MageCart attacks in early September.\n\n\"In this case, the breach is related to several payment exfiltration domain that we saw earlier,\nsuch as g-statistic .com, google-anaiytic .com, msn-analytics .com\"\n\n\n-----\n\nDe Groot further stated that even though the advisory only mentions visiondirect.co.uk,\ndomains for other countries were also affected.\n\nIt wasn't just UK. Also infected between Nov 3rd and\n[Nov8th:https://t.co/fQy7WsKmfqhttps://t.co/8JUn9frF9vhttps://t.co/WBCPQOIv46https:/](https://t.co/fQy7WsKmfq)\n[/t.co/DCyaQzuTkMhttps://t.co/pwfBvDWZDzhttps://t.co/q9of3VMPZ5https://t.co/LclCV3](https://t.co/pwfBvDWZDz)\n[VvHYhttps://t.co/Ouge4ebR7vhttps://t.co/85sRXtC50m](https://t.co/Ouge4ebR7v)\n\n[— Willem de Groot (@gwillem) November 18, 2018](https://twitter.com/gwillem/status/1064111214974906371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWhile the script is heavily obfuscated, one portion containing a list of strings used by the\nscript was easily decoded. In the below script you can see various strings that are being\nmonitored such as payment, checkout, admin, login, password, account, and cart\nsubmissions.\n\n**Decoded Strings**\n[Recently we reported on the Infowars.com's online store also being compromised with a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/infowars-store-affected-by-magecart-credit-card-stealing-hack/)\nMageCart attack. In that attack, the malicious script was also masquerading as Google\nAnalytics but used the domain google-analyitics[.]org instead. While the attack method is\nsimilar, the script itself is quite different.\n\nWhen BleepingComputer asked De Groot if there was any connection between these\nattackers and the one who targeted InfoWars, he said there was no way to conclude that\nthey were same group.\n\n\"Could be, but I have not found other commonalities so far,\" De Groot told\nBleepingComputer. \"They certainly use different type of malware. Sorry, I see it would be\nnice if you could link them up. But cannot say for sure.\"\n\nAlex Jones, the owner of Infowars, felt that his attackers were Communist China, \"Big\nTech\", and the U.S. Democratic party.\n\n\n-----\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted VisionDirect regarding this breach, but had not heard back\nat the time of this publication.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Credit card stealers are getting much stealthier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-credit-card-stealers-are-getting-much-stealthier/)\n\n[Caramel credit card stealing service is growing in popularity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/caramel-credit-card-stealing-service-is-growing-in-popularity/)\n\n[General Motors credential stuffing attack exposes car owners info](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/general-motors-credential-stuffing-attack-exposes-car-owners-info/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[Engineering firm Parker discloses data breach after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/engineering-firm-parker-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
