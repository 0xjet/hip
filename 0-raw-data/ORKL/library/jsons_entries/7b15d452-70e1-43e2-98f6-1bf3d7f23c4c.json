The advisory details the tactics,\ntechniques and procedures, as well as the indicators of compromise, associated with the\nthreat group.\n\n\n-----\n\nDirk Schrader, resident CISO, EMEA, and vice president of security research at\ncybersecurity firm Netwrix, says government-linked APTs such as MuddyWater will use the\nRussia-Ukraine conflict for their own purposes. Knowing that focus and attention are directed\nthere, he says, the groups may use adapted spear-phishing emails while everyone is\nexpecting a massive cyber operation.\n\nMuddyWater was earlier suspected of using ransomware to damage the systems of\norganizations in Israel and other countries. The group is also known as EMP.Zagros, Static\nKitten, Mercury and Seedworm (see: Iranian Hacking Group Suspected of Deploying\n_Ransomware)._\n\n## About MuddyWater\n\nMuddyWater, a subordinate element in the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, has\nconducted broad cyber campaigns in support of MOIS objectives since 2018, the advisory\nsays.\n\n[In 2017 Kaspersky spotted MuddyWater using spear-phishing techniques to target](https://securelist.com/muddywater/88059/)\ngovernment agencies, military institutions, telecommunications companies and universities\nthroughout the Middle East.\n\nThe threat group is positioned to provide the Iranian government with stolen data and access\nto systems and to share these with other malicious cyber actors, the advisory says, citing\nanalysis by the U.K National Cyber Security Center, the U.S. Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation and U.S. Cyber Command's Cyber National Mission Force.\n\nThe Iranian government-sponsored group was exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities and\nleveraging multiple open-source tools to gain access to sensitive government and\ncommercial networks and deploy ransomware, the advisory says. \"These actors also\nmaintain persistence on victim networks via tactics such as side-loading dynamic link\nlibraries, to trick legitimate programs into running malware and obfuscating PowerShell\nscripts to hide command and control functions.\"\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\"MuddyWater attempts to coax their targeted victim into downloading ZIP files, containing\neither an Excel file with a malicious macro that communicates with the actor’s command and\ncontrol server or a PDF file that drops a malicious file to the victim’s network,\" the advisory\nsays.\n\nIt also uses multiple malware sets, such as PowGoop, Small Sieve, Canopy/Starwhale, Mori\nand POWERSTATS for loading malware, backdoor access, persistence and exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT groups will rearrange their TTPs after being called out. That reinforces the need to be\nprepared, to have an established security architecture, with embedded workflows that\ndissolve security silos often seen in organizations, where protecting infrastructure, identities\nand data is handled in different ways, while attackers will use holes in all three layers to\nachieve their objectives,\" Netwrix's Schrader tells Information Security Media Group.\n\n**PowGoop**\n\nThe campaign appears to be using a malicious loader named PowGoop - a fake Google\nUpdate mechanism - consisting of a DLL loader and a PowerShell-based downloader.\n\nThe malicious file impersonates a legitimate file that is signed as a Google Update\nexecutable file. The PowGoop samples analyzed by CISA and CNMF shows it has\ncomponents to retrieve encrypted commands from a C2 server.\n\nSmall Sieve\nA sample analyzed by the NCSC determined Small Sieve to be a Python backdoor\ndistributed using a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System installer, gram_app.exe, which installs\nthe Python backdoor, indoor.exe, and adds it as a registry run key that enables persistence.\n\n\"MuddyWater disguises malicious executables, and uses filenames and registry key names\nassociated with Microsoft's Windows Defender to avoid detection during a casual inspection.\nThe APT group has also used variations of Microsoft (e.g., 'Microsift') and Outlook in its\nfilenames associated with Small Sieve,\" the advisory says.\n\nThe backdoor provides the basic functionality required to maintain and expand a foothold in\nthe victim's infrastructure and avoid detection by using custom string and traffic obfuscation\nschemes together with the Telegram Bot application programming interface, the advisory\nsays. It says the Small Sieve's beacons and tasking are performed using Telegram API.\n\n**Canopy**\n\nCanopy or Starwhale malware is another sample that MuddyWater distributes using spearphishing emails with targeted attachments. In samples analyzed by CISA, a malicious Excel\nfile, Cooperation terms.xls, contained macros written in Visual Basic for Applications and two\nencoded Windows Script Files. When the victim opens the Excel file, they receive a prompt\nto enable macros. Once this occurs, the macros are executed, decoding and installing the\ntwo embedded Windows Script Files.\n\n**Mori**\n\nThe advisory says that the APT group MuddyWater also uses the Mori backdoor, which uses\nDomain Name System tunneling to communicate with the group’s C2 infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to one sample analyzed by CISA, FML.dll, Mori uses a DLL written in C++ that is\nexecuted with regsvr32.exe with export DllRegisterServer, which appears to be a component\nto another program,\" the advisory says.\n\nSome of the tasks performed include deleting the file FILENAME.old and deleting the file by\nregistry value, it says.\n\n**POWERSTATS**\n\nThe APT group is also known to use the POWERSTATS backdoor, which runs PowerShell\nscripts to maintain persistent access to the victim systems.\n\n\"CNMF has posted samples further detailing the different parts of MuddyWater’s new suite of\ntools - along with JavaScript files used to establish connections back to malicious\ninfrastructure - to the malware aggregation tool and repository, Virus Total,\" the advisory\nsays.\n\nThe government agencies recently observed MuddyWater exploiting the Microsoft Netlogon\n[elevation of privilege vulnerability CVE-2020-1472 and the Microsoft Exchange memory](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472)\n[corruption vulnerability CVE-2020-0688.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-0688)\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOrganizations must proactively maintain reasonable cyber hygiene aligned with business\ncontext, says Yaniv Bar-Dayan, CEO and co-founder of cyber risk remediation provider\nVulcan Cyber.\n\n\"IT security teams must first ask themselves: 'What are the crown jewels of my organization?'\nand then work to secure these priorities. An orchestrated and deliberate approach to risk\nmeasurement, management and mitigation will deliver the needed security to protect against\nthe hacker group flavor of the day,\" Bar-Dayan says.\n\nThe joint advisory also recommends deploying application control software to limit the\napplications and executable code that can be run by users. Email attachments and files\ndownloaded via links in emails often contain executable code.\n\n\n-----",
