Tax season is particularly appealing to threat actors because not only are people\nbusy and under stress, but it is intrinsically tied to financial information. With U.S. Tax Day\napproaching, Microsoft has observed phishing attacks targeting accounting and tax return\npreparation firms to deliver the Remcos remote access trojan (RAT) and compromise target\nnetworks beginning in February of this year.\n\nRemcos, which stands for “Remote Control and Surveillance”, is a closed-source tool that\nallows threat actors to gain administrator privileges on Windows systems remotely. It was\nreleased in 2016 by BreakingSecurity, a European company that markets Remcos and other\n[offensive security tools as legitimate software. In 2021, CISA listed Remcos among its top](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-216a)\n[malware strains, citing its use in mass phishing attacks using COVID-19 pandemic themes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/04/08/microsoft-shares-new-threat-intelligence-security-guidance-during-global-crisis/)\ntargeting businesses and individuals.\n\nWhile social engineering lures like this one are common around Tax Day and other big topic\ncurrent events, these campaigns are specific and targeted in a way that is uncommon. The\ntargets for this threat are exclusively organizations that deal with tax preparation, financial\nservices, CPA and accounting firms, and professional service firms dealing in bookkeeping\nand tax. This campaign can be detected in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, built into Windows\nand on by default, as well as Microsoft 365 Defender.\n\nThe campaign uses lures masquerading as tax documentation sent by a client, while the link\nin the email uses a legitimate click-tracking service to evade detection. The target is then\nredirected to a legitimate file hosting site, where the actor has uploaded Windows shortcut\n(.LNK) files.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Remcos malware phishing lure\nThese LNK files generate web requests to actor-controlled domains and/or IP addresses to\ndownload malicious files. These malicious files then perform actions on the target device and\ndownload the Remcos payload, providing the actor potential access to the target device and\nnetwork.\n\nMicrosoft is sharing this information along with detections and recommendations with the\ncommunity to help users and defenders stay vigilant against this campaign with Tax Day\n[approaching in the U.S. on April 18. Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\nAntivirus detect and block Remcos and other malicious activity related to this campaign.\n\n## Phishing campaign analysis\n\nWhat we have observed is that the link in the phishing email points to Amazon Web Services\nclick tracking service at awstrack[.]me. The initial link then redirects the target to a ZIP file\nhosted on legitimate file-sharing service spaces[.]hightail[.]com. The ZIP file contains LNK\nfiles that act as Windows shortcuts to other files. The LNK files make web requests to actorcontrolled domains and\n\nIP addresses to download additional malicious files such as MSI files containing DLLs or\nexecutables, VBScript files containing PowerShell commands, or deceptive PDFs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Unpacked file names referencing tax documents in the malware\nIn some cases, GuLoader was used to execute shellcode and subsequently download\nRemcos on the target system. GuLoader is a malicious downloader that has been used by\nmany different actors to deliver a wide variety of malware, including several RATs such as\nRemcos, through phishing campaigns since it was first observed in the wild in December\n[2019. The downloader uses several techniques to evade analysis and detection such as](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/guloader-malware-analysis/)\nusing legitimate file-sharing sites and cloud hosting services for payload storage and delivery\nas well as encryption and obfuscation of the GuLoader shellcode and payloads.\n\nSuccessful delivery of a Remcos payload could provide an attacker the opportunity to take\ncontrol of the target device to steal information and/or move laterally through the target\nnetwork.\n\nFigure 3. Tax Day-themed Remcos attack chain\nWe continue to learn from these campaigns to improve how we protect customers.\n\n## Recommendations and detections\n\nMicrosoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-javascript-or-vbscript-from-launching-downloaded-executable-content)\nBlock executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list\ncriterion\n[Enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus scanning of downloaded files and attachments](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-advanced-scan-types-microsoft-defender-antivirus?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc%22HYPERLINK%20%22https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-advanced-scan-types-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)\n[Enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time behavior monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc%22HYPERLINK%20%22https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)\n[Enable cloud-delivered protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-demonstration-cloud-delivered-protection?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc%22HYPERLINK%20%22https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/defender-endpoint-demonstration-cloud-delivered-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\n\n## Detection details\n\n**Microsoft Defender for Office 365**\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365 detects phishing emails associated with the campaign\ndiscussed in this blog.\n\n**Microsoft Defender Antivirus**\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus, on by default on Windows machines, detects threat\ncomponents as the following malware:\n\n[Backdoor:Win32/Remcos.GA!MTB](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Backdoor:Win32/Remcos.GA!MTB&threatId=-2147193709?ocid=magicti_ta_ency)\n\n**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**\n\nAlerts with the following titles in the security center can indicate threat activity on your\nnetwork:\n\n‘Remcos’ backdoor\nSuspicious ‘Remcos’ behavior\n‘Remcos’ malware\n‘Guloader’ malware\n\n**Microsoft Sentinel**\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytic (a series of analytics all\nprefixed with “TI map”) to automatically match the indicators mentioned in this blog post with\ndata in their workspace.
