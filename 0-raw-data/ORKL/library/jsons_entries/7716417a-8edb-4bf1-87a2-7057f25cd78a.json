This information can include what’s known as\nproof-of-concept code that demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited to hack\nsystems. A leak of this critically sensitive information significantly shortens the time an\nadversary would need to develop their own exploit for the vulnerability.\n\n[Microsoft told the Associated Press, which first reported the link to MAPP, that it would be](https://apnews.com/article/business-europe-hacking-russia-dd8c331ff30d366ea4f5d828e788c307)\nremoving Positive Technologies from the program.\n\nMAPP recently came under scrutiny after hackers linked to China began exploiting\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers before Microsoft went public with patches.\n[Microsoft has reportedly been investigating whether a partner in MAPP may have leaked](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-probing-whether-leak-played-role-in-suspected-chinese-hack-11615575793)\ninformation Microsoft provided, inadvertently or intentionally, to actors who used it to exploit\nExchange servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the tools used in the second wave of the attack [against Microsoft Exchange\nservers] … believed to have begun on Feb. 28, bear similarities to ‘proof of concept’ attack\ncode that Microsoft distributed to antivirus companies and other security partners on Feb.\n23,” the Wall Street Journal [reported last month. Microsoft didn’t release a public patch to fix](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-probing-whether-leak-played-role-in-suspected-chinese-hack-11615575793)\nthe vulnerabilities until March 2.\n\nMicrosoft has never confirmed the results of its investigation into a leak, nor has anyone\nsuggested that Positive Technologies abused its privileged position in MAPP. But the\ngovernment’s allegations that Positive Technologies assisted Russian intelligence agencies\nwith their offensive hacking operations will likely draw more public criticism and scrutiny of\nMAPP.\n\nPositive Technologies, in a statement posted to its web site on Friday, called the allegations\nbehind the sanctions groundless.\n\n“As a company, we deny the groundless accusations made by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury,” the company wrote. “In the almost 20 years we have been operating there has\nbeen no evidence of the results of Positive Technologies’ research being used in violation of\nthe principles of business transparency and the ethical exchange of information with\nprofessional information security community.”\n\nThe Treasury Department sanctioned six companies on Thursday for assisting Russian\ngovernment hacking operations in various ways, including providing expertise and\ndeveloping malicious hacking tools. Some of those firms allegedly have ties to the recent\nSolarWinds hacking campaign that hit U.S. government agencies and private companies, but\nthe government didn’t identify which companies played a role in that operation.\n\nOf the six, Positive Technologies, which says it earned $73 million last year, stands out for its\nrespected role in the international security community. In addition to its partnership with\nMicrosoft, it also lists HP and VMware as technology partners. [Notably, the government\ndisclosed on Thursday that the Russian foreign intelligence service SVR, which was behind\nthe recent SolarWinds campaign, was also exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in VMWare.]\n\nThe government sanctions announcement doesn’t provide a lot of details to back its claims\nabout cooperation between Positive Technologies and Russian intelligence hackers. But a\nreport published coincidentally by the Atlantic Council last month appears to offer a lot more\ndetail about the activity behind these allegations.\n\nThe report doesn’t mention Positive Technologies at all. Instead it describes an unnamed\nRussian cybersecurity firm that has for years played a decisive role in Russian government\nhacking operations. The lengthy report only discusses the company on a few pages and\nuses a cryptonym or code name to refer to it: ENFER.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The source wouldn t say outright that ENFER and Positive Technologies are the**\n**same, but when asked if it would be incorrect to write that they are the same, the**\n**source said it would not be incorrect.**\n\nBut the concealment effort isn’t very robust and almost immediately after the report came\nout, cybersecurity expert Ryan Naraine spotted language in it that was almost identical to\nlanguage in a document on Positive Technologies’ web site outlining the company’s history.\n\nThe Atlantic report says that Russia’s Ministry of Defense became one of ENFER’s first\nclients within two years after the company was founded. It also says that over the past\ndecade the company has strengthened its cooperation with Russian security services.\n\nPositive Technologies states in its history document that the Russian Ministry of Defense\nbecame one of its first clients in 2004, two years after the company was founded. And in\n2011, it began a cooperative relationship “with Russian law enforcement and security\nagencies.”\n\nNaraine made a cryptic reference to this finding on March 5 in a newsletter he publishes\n[called Security Conversations. All he wrote was that the Atlantic report’s description of](https://securityconversations.com/the-sudden-explosion-of-zero-day-attacks/)\nENFER was “particularly interesting.” But he told Zero Day he was referring to the matching\nlanguage in the Atlantic report and the Positive Technologies document.\n\n**Most notably, the report says that ENFER reverse-engineers malicious code**\n**captured in the wild — particularly malware found infecting Russian government**\n**networks — and then redevelops it as new malware to be used by the Russian**\n**government and others.**\n\nA [story published on Thursday by MIT Technology Review reporter, Patrick Howell O’Neill,](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/15/1022895/us-sanctions-russia-positive-hacking/)\nfurther bolsters the connection between ENFER and Positive Technologies.\n\nIn the article, which is about the Treasury Department sanctions against Positive\nTechnologies, O’Neill reveals what he describes as “previously unreported US intelligence\nassessments” about Positive Technologies that sources provided him. He reveals that the\ncompany “is a major provider of offensive hacking tools, knowledge, and even operations to\nRussian spies.” As an example of this, he notes that the company specifically developed\nexploits for the SS7 telecommunications protocol.\n\nThe SS7 protocol is used by telecommunications networks to route calls and text messages\n[to users wherever they are. The security world has long known about vulnerabilities in SS7](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/the-critical-hole-at-the-heart-of-cell-phone-infrastructure/)\nthat can allow malicious actors to trick telecom networks into sending phone calls and text\nmessages through a system they control so they can intercept the communication. And\n[O’Neill reports that although the company once gave a public demonstration to Forbes about](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/06/01/whatsapp-telegram-ss7-hacks/?sh=3e2c9546178b)\nthe weaknesses in SS7 for purposes of warning users, privately the company “developed\noffensive hacking capabilities to exploit [these SS7 flaws] that were then used by Russian\nintelligence in cyber campaigns ”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Atlantic Council report describes the same about ENFER, but with much greater detail,\nnoting that the company gained some of its knowledge while performing security defensive\nservices for a prominent Russian telecommunication client. It then developed techniques to\nexploit SS7, which were used in the networks of other telecoms who were ENFER\ncustomers, as well as in networks in the Middle East — all “on behalf of other state services.”\nThis appears to imply that SS7 hacking services were provided to the state services of\nMiddle East nations. This included techniques for geolocating phone users, intercepting their\ncommunications and infecting older-generation Android phones with malware.\n\nHow does this connect ENFER to the story that O’Neill wrote about Positive Technologies?\nO’Neill is a co-author on the Atlantic Council report, though he doesn’t mention the report in\nhis MIT Technology Review story. Asked if ENFER is Positive Technologies, O’Neill replied to\nZero Day that the terms of his agreement with the Atlantic Council prevent him from\ndiscussing the report.\n\nA source with knowledge about how the Atlantic Council report was created says O’Neill was\nbrought in as a volunteer to help write up the research conducted by his co-authors. The\nsource wouldn’t say outright that ENFER and Positive Technologies are the same, but when\nasked if it would be incorrect to write that they are the same, the source indicated that it\nwould not be incorrect.\n\nBased on this, the report would appear to provide a lot more information that may have\nserved as the basis for the Treasury Department sanctions against Positive Technologies.\n\n## Well-Connected Security Player\n\nPositive Technologies was founded in 2002 with just six employees and a security scanning\ntool called XSpider, according to the document on its web site that outlines its history. By\n2003, the tool had 300,000 downloads, and in 2004, Russia’s Ministry of Defense became\none of the company’s first major clients, along with a Russian bank and steel and ironworks\nfirm.\n\nIn 2008 the company created a pen-testing team to find vulnerabilities in customer networks\nby trying to hack them, and the next year launched a research center to uncover\nvulnerabilities in software products and report them to vendors for fixing.\n\nIn 2011, it began “cooperation” with Russian law enforcement “and security agencies.” It\ndoesn’t state what that cooperation entailed but that same year it launched an annual\nconference called Positive Hack Days, and its staff jumped from 90 employees to 199. The\nnext year, it had 331 employees and 1,000 corporate clients and opened offices in Italy,\nSouth Korea, Tunisia, U.S., and St. Petersburg, according to the history outline. But the\nAssociated Press reports that although the company has claimed in news releases to have\nan office in Framingham, Massachusetts, it’s not listed in city or state records under that\nname.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2012, the company partnered with Siemens to secure its Simatic WinCC industrial control\nsystem and also became a partner in VMware’s Technology Alliance Program. That same\nyear the National Election Commission of South Korea began using one of its security\nproducts.\n\n[The Siemens Simatic WinCC software is famous for having been targeted by the U.S. and\n[Israel in their 2007-2010 Stuxnet attack against centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz enrichment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KEPLC08/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)\nplant.]\n\nPositive Technologies claims to have more than 1,100 employees and more than 2,000\ncustomers across 30 countries, including ING and Societe Generale — two banking\npowerhouses in Europe — as well as Samsung, the British telecommunications giant BT,\nand SK Telecom of South Korea. The company makes a number of security products that\nare widely used and plays a prominent role in the computer security community by finding\ncritical vulnerabilities in software and hardware and disclosing them to vendors for fixing. In\n2018, it says it published data on 46 security flaws, “including 30 high-risk vulnerabilities\ndiscovered in products from Cisco, Hirschmann, SAP, Schneider Electric, Siemens, and\nother companies.”\n\n**The company boasts that it “has earned the gratitude of such world names as**\n**Google, Adobe, Apple, Red Hat, and Siemens.”**\n\nThe company boasts that it “has earned the gratitude of such world names as Google,\nAdobe, Apple, Red Hat, and Siemens.”\n\n[Last year, its researchers discovered and disclosed a major unfixable flaw in Intel chips that](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/5-years-of-intel-cpus-and-chipsets-have-a-concerning-flaw-thats-unfixable/)\ncould undermine the chips’ built-in encryption and other security features.\n\n“This vulnerability jeopardizes everything Intel has done to build the root of trust and lay a\nsolid security foundation on the company’s platforms,” Mark Ermolov, a security researcher\nwith Positive Technologies wrote in a blog post.\n\nRiding on these successes, the company has recently been contemplating an initial public\noffering, according to a Russian newspaper.\n\n## Leading a Double Life\n\nBut according to the U.S. government, Positive Technologies has for years been leading a\ndouble life, secretly helping Russian intelligence agencies hack targets in the U.S. and\nelsewhere, providing expertise and developing tools and infrastructure. Positive\nTechnologies also allegedly uses an annual security conference it hosts in Russia to recruit\nskilled hackers on behalf of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s Main\nIntelligence Directorate (GRU) and its Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Treasury Department didn t identify the conference by name, but it appears to be\nPositive Hack Days (PHDays), which drew 8,000 attendees in 2019. This year’s event will be\nheld in Moscow May 20-21.\n\n[A 2018 story in the](https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-hacker-party-is-ground-zero-for-russias-cyberspies-3) _[Daily Beast called the conference “ground zero for Russia’s cyber spies.”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-hacker-party-is-ground-zero-for-russias-cyberspies-3)_\nReporter Kevin Poulsen found among the conference’s online lists of past attendees the\nnames of two GRU officers who have been charged in the U.S. with breaching the\nDemocratic National Committee in 2016. The names of other attendees match Russian\nhackers who have been indicted for interfering in the 2016 presidential election in other\nways.\n\nIt should be noted, though, that the conference isn’t much different than the annual DefCon\nhacker conference, held in Las Vegas, where researchers and hackers demonstrate hacks\nagainst critical infrastructure, banks, cars, and voting machines. U.S. and foreign intelligence\n[agencies regularly attend DefCon to recruit skilled hackers and researchers.](https://www.wired.com/2012/07/nsa-chief-denies-dossiers/)\n\nTo understand more the possible reasons behind the sanctions against Positive\nTechnologies, we have to again turn to the Atlantic report about ENFER.\n\nAccording to the report, ENFER, maintains a public and a secret face — publicly offering\ncode-auditing services, penetration testing, vulnerability research and threat intelligence\nservices to corporate and government clients, while providing weaponized exploits to the\nRussian spy agencies. The work is done “in response to direct tasking by officers of the FSB\non specific projects involving offensive activities,” the report states. This includes “exploit\ndiscovery and weaponization, malware development, and infrastructure engineering” as well\nas the development of offensive tools for conducting system and network reconnaissance\nand exfiltrating documents.\n\nAlthough ENFER, like Positive Technologies, is publicly considered a good corporate citizen\nby using the software vulnerabilities it finds only for penetration testing and other defensive\nsecurity activities, the company gave the same capabilities to Russian government clients,\nthe report alleges. The pen-testing ENFER does to test customer networks and the\nvulnerabilities it discloses to vendors to be patched are merely ways to provide “a veneer of\nlegitimacy” and plausible deniability about the other work it does for the Russian government,\nthe report alleges.\n\nMost notably, the report says that ENFER reverse-engineers malicious code captured in the\nwild — particularly malware found infecting Russian government networks — and then\nredevelops it as new malware to be used by the Russian government and others.\n\n**The work is done “in response to direct tasking by officers of the FSB on**\n**specific projects involving offensive activities,” the report states.**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn at least one case, this allegedly involved a malware family that was found and which\n“Russian researchers” attributed to a hacking campaign conducted by a member of the Five\nEyes spy alliance that got detected “between 2014 and 2015.” Evidently a zero-day exploit\nused by this actor was discovered and then allegedly “repurposed by ENFER for use in other\nintrusions.”\n\nThis appears to be referencing the U.S., which is a member of the Five Eyes spy alliance\nthat includes the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The malware family likely refers\nto a suite of NSA hacking tools dubbed the Equation Group that the Moscow-based antivirus\n[firm Kaspersky Lab says it discovered in 2014 and then publicly exposed in 2015. Kaspersky](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/kapersky-discovers-equation-group/)\nhas said the first Equation Group component it discovered was found on a system in the\nMiddle East that was also infected with several other families of malware from various\nnation-state actors.\n\nThe zero-day exploit that ENFER reverse-engineered for use in other intrusions sounds like\nEternal Blue, an Equation Group tool that wasn’t discovered by Kaspersky, but was released\npublicly in August 2016 by a mysterious hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers who\nare believed to be from one of the Russian intelligence agencies. The repurposing of this\nexploit may refer to two incidents in which Eternal Blue was re-used in hacking operations.\nOn May 12, 2017, it was used to spread the WannaCry ransomware worm to computers\naround the world. The next month it was also used to spread the NotPetya attack around the\nworld, beginning with computers in Ukraine. The NotPetya worm has been attributed to\nRussia; WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea.\n\nBut ENFER didn’t just hand off tools to government hackers. The Atlantic report alleges that\nit was “directly involved” in command and control of operations — meaning it managed\nservers and tools used to communicate and send commands to malware planted on hijacked\nmachines.\n\n“The extent to which ENFER staff have been involved in the planning and management of\noperations remains unclear,” the report notes. It’s also possible that some of the activity\nENFER conducted was done at the direction of a state but was essentially ENFER\nemployees engaging in cybercriminal hacking for their own purposes or for other non-state\npartners.\n\nIt’s also not clear how much of ENFER’s activity is voluntary. The report notes that FSB\noversight of ENFER includes “threats against individual staffers’ families” to keep them\nmotivated to cooperate with the FSB.\n\n[Author note: this story has been updated to identify where Kaspersky discovered the first\nEquation Group tool and to clarify that O’Neill worked on the report as an unpaid volunteer.]\n\n[Share](https://zetter.substack.com/p/sanctioned-firm-accused-of-helping?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\nComment\n\n\n-----\n\nShare\n\nShare this post\n\nSanctioned Firm Accused of Helping Russian Intelligence Was Part of Microsoft’s Early Vuln\nAccess Program — MAPP\n\nzetter.substack.com\n\n\n-----",
