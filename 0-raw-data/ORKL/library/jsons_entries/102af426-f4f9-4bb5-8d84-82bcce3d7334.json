    "plain_text": "_Contributor: Yi Li_\n\nA group of attackers, which we call Scarab, has been performing highly targeted attacks against particular\n\nRussian-speaking individuals both inside and outside of Russia since at least January 2012. In each\n\ncampaign, the attackers typically target a small amount of individuals−rather than enterprises or\n\ngovernments−using economic, military, topical, or generic lures. On average, less than ten unique\n\ncomputers are infected per month and there is no indication that the attackers are trying to spread\n\nthrough the victim’s local network, suggesting that Scarab’s campaigns are extremely targeted in nature.\n\n[Many of Scarab’s campaigns focus on distributing the group’s custom malware (Trojan.Scieron and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-072320-5920-99)\n\n[Trojan.Scieron.B) through emails with malicious attachments. These files contain exploits that take](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-081114-0917-99)\n\nadvantage of older vulnerabilities that are already patched by vendors. If the attackers successfully\n\ncompromise the victims’ computers, then they use a basic back door threat called Trojan.Scieron to drop\n\nTrojan.Scieron.B on to the computer. Trojan.Scieron.B has a rootkit-like component that hides some of its\n\nnetwork activity and features more enhanced back door functionality.\n\n**Who are the Scarab attackers?**\n\nBased on our research, the Scarab attackers are a technically capable group, judging on how they have\n\ncustom-developed several malicious tools for these campaigns. However, they are not highly skilled or\n\nwell resourced, as they rely on older exploits and executables stored in compressed archives to distribute\n\ntheir threats.\n\n\n-----\n\nlanguage characters, and they seem to mostly target Russian speakers located in Russia and other regions\n\naround the world.\n\n_Figure 1 Scarab victims based on Symantec telemetry_\n\nThe group conducts command-and-control (C&C) operations almost exclusively through the use of\n\ndynamic domain name system (DNS) domains. The C&C servers are usually hosted in South Korea;\n\nhowever, there have been instances where servers were located in other countries.\n\nFor the majority of 2012, there was not much information about Scarab’s victims. However from October\n\n2012, a number of emails used by Scarab were blocked by Symantec .Cloud. All of the emails were sent\n\nfrom @yandex.ru email addresses.\n\n**Early attacks**\n\nOn October 29, 2012, an email with the Russian language subject “Экспериментальное определение\n\nэффективно” was sent to two individuals working for a large retail organization. Translated to English,\n\nthe email’s subject is “Experimental definition is effective.”\n\nThese emails contained Microsoft Word attachments that triggered an exploit taking advantage of the\n\n[Microsoft Windows Common Controls ActiveX Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/52911)\n\n0158). Once triggered, the exploit dropped a copy of Trojan.Scieron onto the victim’s computer. The\n\nattackers continued to intermittently send emails with doc malware droppers until August 2013\n\n\n-----\n\nPapers - Conferences / Journal Special Issues, January 2013 to two individuals. The attackers sent the\n\nmessage to email accounts associated with an Australian funded academic research project that had\n\nconcluded in 2010. It is possible that the researchers were continuing to use the email accounts for\n\nunrelated topics and this was why the attackers chose to target them. Seven days later, another email was\n\nsent to the same two individuals, this time with a Russian language subject of “Информация по\n\nобслуживанию высвобожденны,”which translates to “Service-related information are released” (sic).\n\n**G20 summit focus**\n\nFrom this point on, at least until January of 2014, the attackers moved to finance-related lures and\n\ntargets. In April, the attackers sent an email with the subject “G20 receives clean bill of health at Boao” to\n\na European government target.\n\nIn August, they sent another email to six people working for an international economic organisation. This\n\nemail had the Russian language subject of “G20 на 2013 г” which translates to “G20 for 2013.”\n\nIn August, a final G20-related email was sent to two individuals working in the Economic Ministry of a\n\nEuropean government. That email had the English language subject “About G20 details.”\n\n**Russian news lures**\n\nThere were no further emails discovered and no active infections detected until January 2014, when\n\nScarab’s activity resumed and continued up to now. From that month on, the attackers have been using\n\n“.scr” files to drop Trojan.Scieron. The titles of these .scr files are usually in Russian, and are a hint as to\n\nthe nature of the targets. It’s very likely that the .scr files are being delivered by email; however this has\n\nnot been confirmed. It is also likely and again, unconfirmed−that the .scr files are embedded in .rar files.\n\nOne example of the group’s malicious .scr file names is “Россия к 2016 году проведет испытания\n\nгазовых турбин для военных кораблей.” This translates to “Russian Federation to 2016 will test gas\n\nturbines for warships.” The title comes from an article, published in June 2014, on a Russian media\n\nwebsite.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The attackers used the titles of news articles from a Russian media site for their malicious files’_\n\n_names_\n\nAnother more recent file name was “план работы на июнь 2014 года.doc.scr” which translates to the\n\nquite generic “work plan for June 2014 year.doc.src.”\n\nLooking at the total number of infections per country in Figure 1 based on Symantec telemetry, it’s clear\n\nthat Russia, or at least Russian speakers, are the primary targets of the Scarab attackers, although non\nRussian speakers have been targeted as well.\n\n**Scarab’s malware**\n\nIn all of these campaigns, the attackers have attempted to compromise victims’ computers with a variant\n\nof Trojan.Scieron. This is a basic back door threat that is used to download additional malware onto the\n\ntarget’s computer.\n\nThe main payload of Trojan.Scieron is within a DLL file. This file is dropped either from a Trojanized\n\nMicrosoft Word document or from other PE files.\n\nOnce the Trojan compromises the victim’s computer, it is able to perform the following actions:\n\n\n-----\n\ndrive type\n\nDownload additional files\n\nExecute files\n\nRetrieve specific files from the victim’s computer\n\nList directories\n\nDelete files\n\nMove files to other folders\n\nIn most of the investigated incidents, Trojan.Scieron has been used to download an enhanced version of\n\nitself, which Symantec detects as Trojan.Scieron.B. This threat includes a basic ‘rootkit-like’ tool which\n\nhides some of its network activity.\n\nTrojan.Scieron.B’s file names seen to date are usually seclog32.dll (back door) and hidsvc.dat (rootkit).\n\nThe back door’s functionality includes the following features:\n\nCreate, list, and terminate processes\n\nRead, set, and delete registry entries\n\nRead, write, list, and delete files and directories\n\nGather cached URLs\n\nLaunch remote shell\n\nGather recent active files\n\nRetrieve details from its configuration file\n\nTrojan.Scieron.B’s ‘rootkit’ functionality allows it to hide a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port in\n\ncommunications.\n\n**Symantec and Norton protection**\n\nThe Scarab attackers have been consistently targeting a select number of victims with custom malware\n\nover the last few years. While the group uses older exploits, their campaigns seem to have had some\n\nsuccess, judging on how they have continued to operate similar campaigns over the years. The attackers’\n\nfocus on Russian speakers shows that they have specific targets in mind and they continue to adjust the\n\nsubject of their email campaigns to successfully compromise their victims.\n\nSymantec .Cloud blocks emails that come from the Scarab attackers. Symantec and Norton products also\n\noffer the following detections against Scarab’s custom malware\n\n[Trojan.Scieron](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-072320-5920-99)\n\n[Trojan.Scieron.B](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-081114-0917-99)\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromising your computer:\n\nExercise caution when receiving unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails\n\nAvoid clicking on links in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails\n\nAvoid opening attachments in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails\n\nUpdate the software, operating system, and browser plugins on your computer to prevent attackers\n\nfrom exploiting known vulnerabilities.\n\n[Use comprehensive security software, such as Norton Security, to protect yourself from malware.](http://us.norton.com/)\n\n**Indicators of compromise (IoC)**\n\n[For a full list of IoCs, please check out our indicators of compromise document.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/docs/Scarab_IOCs_January_2015.txt)\n\n\n-----",
