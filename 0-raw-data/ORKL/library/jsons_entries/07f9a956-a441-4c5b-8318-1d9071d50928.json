One that we initially identified as Arkei turned\n[out to be Vidar, a new piece of malware recently analyzed in detail by Fumik0_ in his](https://twitter.com/fumik0_)\npost: _[Let’s dig into Vidar – An Arkei Copycat/Forked Stealer (In-depth analysis).](https://fumik0.com/2018/12/24/lets-dig-into-vidar-an-arkei-copycat-forked-stealer-in-depth-analysis/)_\n\nIn Norse Mythology, **_[Víðarr is a god and son of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%AD%C3%B0arr)_** [Odin, whose death it is foretold he will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin)\navenge. Being referred to as “The Silent One” seems to be fitting for this stealer that can\nloot from browser histories (including Tor Browser) and cryptocurrency wallets, capture\ninstant messages, and much more.\n\nWe witnessed a threat actor using the Fallout exploit kit to distribute Vidar. But victims won’t\nnotice that as much, as the secondary and noisier payload being pushed is GandCrab\nransomware.\n\n## Overview\n\nA malvertising chain leads us to the Fallout exploit kit followed by what we thought was an\nArkei stealer. Upon closer look, while the sample did share a lot of similarities with Arkei\n(including network events), it was actually a newer and, at the time, not yet publicly\ndescribed piece of malware now identified as Vidar.\n\n\n-----\n\nBeyond Vidar’s stealer capabilities, we also noticed a secondary payload that was retrieved\nfrom Vidar’s own command and control (C2) server. The infection timeline showed that\nvictims were first infected with Vidar, which tried to extract confidential information, before\neventually being compromised with the GandCrab ransomware.\n\n## Malvertising and Fallout exploit kit\n\nTorrent and streaming video sites drive a lot of traffic, and their advertising is often\naggressive and poorly-regulated. A malicious actor using a rogue advertising domain is\nredirecting these site visitors according to their geolocation and provenance to at least two\ndifferent exploit kits (Fallout EK and GrandSoft EK), although the former is the most active.\n\nStealers such as AZORult seem to be the a favorite payload here, but we also noticed that\nArkei/Vidar was quite common. In this particular instance, we saw Vidar being pushed via the\nFallout exploit kit.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Vidar\n\nIt should be noted that Vidar is sold as a product, and as such can be distributed by several\ndifferent threat groups through different campaigns.\n\nVidar customers can customize the stealer via profiles, which gives them a way to adjust\nwhich kind of data they are interested in. Beyond the usual credit card numbers and other\npasswords stored in applications, Vidar can also scrape an impressive selection of digital\nwallets.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution on the system, Vidar will search for any data specified in its profile\nconfiguration and immediately send it back to the C2 server via an unencrypted HTTP POST\nrequest.\n\nThis includes high level system details (specs, running processes, and installed applications)\nand stats about the victim (IP address, country, city, and ISP) stored in a file\ncalled information.txt. This file is packaged along with other stolen data and zipped before\nbeing sent back to the C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\n## GandCrab as a loader\n\nVidar also offers to download additional malware via its command and control server. This is\nknown as the loader feature, and again, it can be configured within Vidar’s administration\npanel by adding a direct URL to the payload. However, not all instances of Vidar (tied to a\nprofile ID) will download an additional payload. In that case, the server will send back a\nresponse of “ok” instead of a URL.\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: \nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nConnection: keep-alive\nServer: Pro-Managed\nContent-Length: 51\nhttp://ovz1.fl1nt1kk.10301.vps.myjino[.]ru/topup.exe;\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWithin about a minute after the initial Vidar infection, the victim s files will be encrypted and\ntheir wallpaper hijacked to display the note for GandCrab version 5.04.\n\n## Ransomware as a last payload\n\n[While ransomware experienced a slowdown in 2018, it is still one of the more dangerous](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware)\nthreats. In contrast to many other types of malware, ransomware is instantly visible and\nrequires a call to action, whether victims decide to pay the ransom or not.\n\nHowever, threat actors can use ransomware for a variety of reasons within their playbook. It\ncould be, for instance, a simple decoy where the real goal is to irreversibly corrupt systems\nwithout any way to recover lost data. But as we see here, it can be coupled with other threats\nand used as a last payload when other resources have already been exhausted.\n\nAs a result, victims get a double whammy. Not only are they robbed of their financial and\npersonal information, but they are also being extorted to recover the now encrypted data.\n\nMalwarebytes users are protected against this threat at multiple levels. Our signatureless\nanti-exploit engine mitigates the Internet Explorer and Flash Player exploits delivered by the\n[Fallout exploit kit.
