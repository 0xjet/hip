See. It looks like the version 3.7 I analyzed wasn’t totally finished,_\n_because in the one I analyze, the campaign number nor the DGA haven’t been updated, while_\n_the tweet shows a version 3.7 where all modifications have been made._\n\n_March 29, 2nd update: this is moving rapidly, version 3.8 is already out: see ._\n\nSince Friday (March 26, 2021), Android/Flubot is propagating a new version, v3.7. For\nreminder, Android/Flubot is an Android banking malware, which surfaced in November 2020.\nIn short, the malware abuses yet and again Android’s Accessibility Services. For example, to\ndisable Play Protect, or display overlay windows to grab credit card info. But it also abuses the\nAccessibility Services for features I had not seen in other malware before like automatically\n_accepting to send SMS messages._ Read this [analysis from Prodaft for more details. I won’t](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/master/FluBot/FluBot.pdf)\nrepeat what’s in the report and only focus on differences.\n\n## New version 3.7 is currently distributing!\n\nThis video shows Flubot 3.6 in action, and communicating with a live C&C. The name of the\nC&C is generated via a proprietary algorithm. The communication with the C&C is encrypted :\nwe use a Frida hook to display the messages before encryption or after decryption. The video\ncaptures the C&C requesting list of contacts, SMS, disabling Play Protect and asking to\npropagate malware via SMS with links to infected sites. Those infected sites currently\npropagate v3.7.\nThe list of APK distribution domains is long (see at the end of this article in section “IoCs”)\nand changes frequently. The websites check the browser’s user agent matches an Android\nplatform, and won’t respond to other platforms (i.e you have to append a fake Android user\nagent to get the pages). The served page is the same as in Prodaft’s report, except we\ncurrently view the German campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen you click to download the application, you get a recent version of the malware.\nSeveral of these domains currently serve an APK sha256\n```\ne4d70de608d9491119bacd0729a5a2f55ce477227bd7b55d88fa2086486e886d which an even\n\n```\nmore recent version of Flubot. This sample is packed (like others) and is a new version, 3.7, of\n**Flubot.**\n\n\n-----\n\nNew version of the day for Android/Flubot: 3.7 (March 26, 2021)\n\n## What’s new in v3.7?\n\nActually, close to nothing both in the code and obfuscated strings. Reminder: strings are\n[obfuscated using “paranoid” Java library. You can de-obfuscate all strings of v3.6 and v3.7 with](https://github.com/MichaelRocks/paranoid)\nmy stand-alone source code.\n\n\n-----\n\nDe-obfuscated strings of v3.6 left, and v3.7 right. There are close to no difference.\nThe only difference lies in preparing support for the hungarian language.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code shows new localized strings for Hungary in v3.7.\n**Does this mean the next campaign of Flubot is going to target Hungarian end-users? It’s**\nquite uncertain currently, especially because although the `HU_TEXT entry is present,`\nhungarian strings haven’t been added yet, and the rest of the code does not support `.hu`\nlocale. In addition, the campaign indicator `ProgConfig.CAMP_NUM_PREF is still set to Germany`\n(49).\n\n## Take away summary\n\nBecause of string obfuscation, the . However, the de-obfuscated content is very similar.\nActually, the only notable change in 3.7 looks like . Yet, the current campaign still targets\ngerman speaking end-users.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can watch a (see beginning of article). The communication flow with the C&C thanks\nto a Frida hook which displays text before encryption.\nIf you wish to work on Flubot, (obfuscation, domain name generation, Frida hooks) are\navailable: see References below\nAn updated is provided in Appendix.\n\n## References\n\n.\nhook by Prodaft.
