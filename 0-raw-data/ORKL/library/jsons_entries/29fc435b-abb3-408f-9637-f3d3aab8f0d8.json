    "plain_text": "# The Prelude to Ransomware: A Look into Current QAKBOT Capabilities and Global Activities\n\n#### Technical Brief\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nQAKBOT (detected by Trend Micro as TrojanSpy.Win32.QAKBOT) is a modular and highly\nevasive information-stealing malware that was first discovered in 2007. This threat is also\nknown as QBOT and PinkSlipbot. Initial versions of QAKBOT targeted financial data and was\nclassified as a banking trojan, but more recent versions have acted as a delivery mechanism for\n“second stage” malware. Specifically, QAKBOT seems to lead to targeted attacks involving data\ntheft (exfiltration) and ransomware.\n\n## QAKBOT Capabilities\n\nThe core QAKBOT loader functionality is extended using a variety of plug-ins. In earlier\nQAKBOT versions, components were embedded as resources in the main executable. In more\nrecent versions, the injection DLL, update script, and plug-ins are downloaded by the QAKBOT\ncore after communicating with the command-and-control (C&C) server. The plug-ins listed here\nprovide QAKBOT operators with the functionality needed to achieve their objectives.\n\n**Plug-in** **Capability**\n\nEnables theft of sensitive data (usernames, passwords)\n**Web-inject modules**\nwithin browser processes\n\nEnables theft of sensitive data from compromised\n**Password grabber module**\nendpoints\n\nEnables the theft of cookies from web browsers (Internet\n**Cookie grabber module**\nExplorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge)\n\nEnables the theft of email threads, which are hijacked\n**Email Collector module**\nand used in follow-on campaigns\n\n**Universal Plug and Play** Enables the use of infected machine as proxies for C&C\n**UPnP module** traffic\n\n**Lateral Movement module** Enables propagation inside the infected network\n\nProvides hands on keyboard and lateral movement\n**Hidden VNC (hVNC) module**\ncapabilities to the operators\n\nEnables remote access to the compromised network\n**Cobalt Strike module**\nwith the Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework\n\nEnables remote access to the compromised network via\n**Atera module**\nAtera Remote Monitoring Management (RMM) software\n\n|Plug-in|Capability|\n|---|---|\n|Web-inject modules|Enables theft of sensitive data (usernames, passwords) within browser processes|\n|Password grabber module|Enables theft of sensitive data from compromised endpoints|\n|Cookie grabber module|Enables the theft of cookies from web browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge)|\n|Email Collector module|Enables the theft of email threads, which are hijacked and used in follow-on campaigns|\n|Universal Plug and Play UPnP module|Enables the use of infected machine as proxies for C&C traffic|\n|Lateral Movement module|Enables propagation inside the infected network|\n|Hidden VNC (hVNC) module|Provides hands on keyboard and lateral movement capabilities to the operators|\n|Cobalt Strike module|Enables remote access to the compromised network with the Cobalt Strike penetration testing framework|\n|Atera module|Enables remote access to the compromised network via Atera Remote Monitoring Management (RMM) software|\n\n\n-----\n\n## QAKBOT Links to Targeted Ransomware Attacks\n\nQAKBOT operators are key enablers for ransomware attacks. These operators achieve access\nto infected environments through the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons, which function as\nstandalone backdoors, or via a Cobalt Strike or Atera RMM plug-in. Since 2019, QAKBOT\ninfections have led to the eventual deployment of the following human-operated ransomware\nfamilies:\n\n   - MegaCortex (2019)   - Egregor (2020)\n\n   - PwndLocker (2019)   - Sodinokibi/REvil (2021)\n\n   - ProLock (2020)\n\n## QAKBOT Activity \n\nThe following is a list of notable events related to QAKBOT, as well as information from Trend\nMicro™ Smart Protection Network™. Trend Micro has been monitoring this threat for years, and\nwe have been able to track the spam campaigns linked to QAKBOT operators across the world.\nWhile monitoring this malware distribution activity, we found that the top countries targeted were\nthe United States, Japan, and Germany, while, telecommunications, technology, and education\nwere the top industries targeted.\n\n|Date|Event|\n|---|---|\n|Oct 2021|The Atera RMM plug-in is discovered.|\n|Sep 2021|Shathak delivers QAKBOT with malspam. “TR” delivers QAKBOT with malspam.|\n|Feb 2021 – Jun 2021|Shathak delivers QAKBOT with malspam.|\n|Mar 2021|QAKBOT infections drop Cobalt Strike.1|\n|Mar 2020|QAKBOT infections lead to the ProLock Ransomware.|\n|Oct 2019|QAKBOT infections lead to the PwndLocker Ransomware.|\n|May 2019|QAKBOT infections lead to the MegaCortex Ransomware.|\n|Jun 2018|The QAKBOT malware is found on thumb drives manufactured in China.2|\n|2007|The initial QAKBOT version is discovered.|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.

The top 10 countries where QAKBOT is distributed\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nThe QAKBOT infection chain usually starts with malicious spam emails and the infection\nspreads from there. The stages shown here are typical of QAKBOT but might vary slightly over\ntime.\n\n|Stage|#|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Arrival|1| Malicious spam emails with malicious attachment  The document uses Excel 4.0 macros and themed social engineering to trick users into opening the email.|\n|Infection|2| The excel document contains Excel 4.0 macrso with a malicious dropper routine that will download the QAKBOT DLL from a remote server.  Social engineering is used to trick the user into “Enabling Content” (macros).|\n||3| Once macros are enabled, the QAKBOT loader DLL is downloaded and executed.  Persistence is achieved through the installation of registry keys and a scheduled task.  The malicious QAKBOT process phones home to the C&C server.|\n||4| The C&C server sends additional modules to the infected host .|\n||5| Target information is stolen.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Post- infection|Col2| Attackers might obtain “hands on keyboard” access to the infected environment following the deployment of a backdoor (such as Cobalt Strike) as a plug-in or as a separate dropped file.  Attackers might execute discovery commands to further evaluate the environment.|\n|---|---|---|\n||6| Attackers might move laterally from the infected host.  In some cases, attackers will deploy ransomware in the environment.|\n\n\nTable 1. Illustration and steps of the QAKBOT kill chain\n\n## QAKBOT Arrival Variations\n\nQAKBOT uses a variety of delivery mechanisms, including different scripting languages and\nmalicious documents. In the past, QAKBOT has also collaborated with other botnet operators,\nnamely the now defunct Emotet.\n\n_*Emotet is an example of malware installation as a service, wherein operators install other_\n_malware on their bots for a fee._\n\nFigure 3. QAKBOT delivery mechanisms\n\n\n-----\n\n## QAKBOT Malicious Documents and Excel 4.0 Macros\n\nSince late 2020, QAKBOT operators have leveraged malicious Microsoft Excel documents with\nheavily obfuscated Excel 4.0 macros to evade detection in the initial access phase of the attack.\n\nFigure 4. Malicious document delivering QAKBOT (from June 2021 MalSpam Campaign)\n\nThe primary motivation behind QAKBOT’s (and other malware distributors’) shift toward this\ndelivery mechanism can likely be attributed to the lack of support for Excel 4.0 macros in the\nWindows AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI) at that time. Excel 4.0 macro support was only\nadded to AMSI in March 2021, while VBA macro parsing has been supported by AMSI since\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\n## QAKBOT Operators’ Use of Hijacked Email Conversations\n\nThe use of hijacked email conversations is a noteworthy technique used by QAKBOT\ndistributors as a social engineering tactic. In the example shown in Figure 5, an email thread\nbetween Kelly and Sandy (number 1 in the figure) was stolen during a previous infection by the\nQAKBOT email collection module. The thread is then reused or hijacked by QAKBOT operators\n(number 2 in the figure) in a malicious spam campaign. The malicious email appears to come\nfrom Sandy in reply — but it actually contains the malicious document that drops QAKBOT\n(number 3 in the figure).\n\nThe use of hijacked email threads in malicious spam emails is a tactic that was first used by the\ncybercriminals who operated the now defunct Emotet malware.\n\nFigure 5. The hijacked email thread delivering QAKBOT\n\n\n-----\n\n## QAKBOT Infection Routine \n\nFigure 6 shows that the XLSM files contain hidden sheets and an auto_open macro (step 1 in\nthis figure) that executes as soon as the victim opens the document and selects the “Enable\nContent” button. The macro code evaluates a sequence of formulas that are distributed at\nvarious indexes (step 2 in this figure) in the document. This is an obfuscation technique that is\ndesigned to thwart detection using simple strings.\n\nFigure 6. The Excel formulas containing malicious code fragments\n\nFigure 7. Hidden sheets in a QAKBOT XLSM dropper\n\nIn the sample in Figure 8, the code generates a unique file name using NOW() (step 1 in this\nfigure) to output a timestamp to be used as part of the file name. The dynamic URL formation\nmakes it harder to block exact URLs. Next, the functions (step 2 in this figure) to be called are\nresolved and the first of three download attempts from hard-coded hosts begins (step 3 in this\nfigure). The downloaded file is stored in the disk as “Post.storg*”. This is the main QAKBOT\nDLL, which is loaded by “regsvr32 -s” (step 4 in this figure). The QAKBOT main loader DLL is\nloaded by regsvr32.exe with the -s command.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Analysis of QAKBOT sample\n\n## QAKBOT Installation \n\n### Packed QAKBOT loader  Process hollowing\n\nThe main program is unpacked in memory and injected into a new process that started in a\nsuspended state. The injection routine targets the process memory of one of three targets\n(iexplore.exe, mobsync.exe, or explorer.exe) where the target is unmapped and replaced with\nthe unpacked QAKBOT loader program. Once the code is injected, QAKBOT calls\nResumeThread().\n\nFigure 9. Process hollowing (UnmapViewOfFile -> VirtualAlloc)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistence mechanisms and anti-analysis/anti-sandbox routines\n\nThe loader creates a persistence via a scheduled task using the now deprecated at.exe. A\ndropped Javascript file creates a scheduled task for persistence for the QAKBOT core. The\nsame mechanism is executed when an update is received from the C&C server.\n\nFigure 10. Persistence mechanisms through scheduled tasks\n\nQAKBOT also includes several routines to detect the presence of security software, and to\ndetect if it is being executed on a virtual machine (VM).\n\nFigure 11. Routines to detect if there are security solutions on the device\n\n\n-----\n\n### QAKBOT UPnP: Recruiting new proxies for QAKBOT’s botnet\n\nQAKBOT leverages Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) to identify other devices on the\nlocal network. It then parses network device information collected with SSDP to identify internet\ngateways.\n\nFigure 12. QAKBOT leveraging SSDP and parsing information collected with SSDP\n\nWith gateways identified, it uses UPnP to create port-forwarding rules on gateway devices to\nroute traffic from the internet to the infected endpoint. The infected device is then capable of\nacting as a Tier 3 proxy in the QAKBOT botnet.\n\nFigure 13. UpnP used to create port-forwarding rules\n\n\n-----\n\n## QAKBOT Information Stealing Plug-ins\n\n### Outlook email collector\n\nQAKBOT has been exfiltrating emails from Microsoft Outlook since 2019. The stolen information\nis used to enhance the social engineering capabilities of future attacks by spamming email\nthread members. QAKBOT extracts emails, parses email headers, and extracts thread\nrecipients from the address book.\n\nFigure 14. The emailcollector_dll\n\nFigure 15. Invoking the “GetEmailMsgRecipients()” function\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Extraction of email address using email regex and CollectOutlookData() function call\n\nThe QAKBOT email collector plug-in performs email header parsing to identify interesting\nheader items. This process includes parsing email authentication results from DomainKeys\nIdentified Mail (DKIM) signatures and antispam detection results. The email collector module\nalso collects data from the Microsoft Outlook address book. After the collection, stolen data is\nuploaded with HTTPS POST (not FTP as used by QAKBOT for other data exfiltration).\n\nFigure 17. Email header parsing\n\nFigure 18. The function call to collect address book information\n\nCollectOutlookAddressBookThread()\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Function showing the email data exfiltration method\n\n### Password grabber plug-in\n\nThe QAKBOT password grabber module can extract credentials (username, password, and\nhost) from the following applications:\n\n   - Outlook   - Internet Explorer   - Chrome\n\n   - CuteFTP   - Firefox\n\nPopular browser and email clients are potential targets, and CuteFTP, a rarely used FTP client,\nis also on the list. There are a few interesting points to note when looking over the list of\ntargeted applications. For example, we know that QAKBOT uses stolen FTP details for the\npurpose of data exfiltration channels. Chrome no longer supports FTP, so malicious actors\nwould need to grab credentials out of a separate application to steal FTP credentials. Also,\nQAKBOT uses Network Security Service (NSS) libraries (nss.dll) to interact with Firefox\npassword storage and pilfer credentials from the Firefox SQLite database\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. The password-grabbing function “plugin_passgrabber”\n\nFigure 21. CuteFTP password extraction routines\n\nFigure 22. Chrome password extraction routines\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. Outlook credential extraction routines\n\nFigure 24. Internet Explorer credential extraction routines\n\nFigure 25. QAKBOT using NSS libraries to interact with Firefox\n\n\n-----\n\n### Digital certificate theft\n\nQAKBOT is also able to steal digital certificates. It enumerates the installed digital certificates\nwith CertEnumSystemStore() and extracts both the certificate names and the data.\n\nQAKBOT leverages FTP account information stored in the configuration to exfiltrate the stolen\ndata. The FTP accounts are legitimate user accounts that were likely compromised in previous\nQAKBOT infections. In other words, the domains are not simply malicious domains created for\nthe sole purpose of harvesting data stolen by QAKBOT.\n\nFigure 26. QAKBOT function to steal and exfiltrate stolen data\n\n\n-----\n\n## QAKBOT Campaigns \n\n### 1H 2021 campaign details\n\nIn the observed campaigns, the threat actors use both “financial” (compensation, overdue debt,\nrebate) and “business process” (claim, complaint, document) email header lures to entrap\nvictims.\n\nFigure 27. Detection of spam campaign lures from January 2021 to July 2021\n\nThe attachment name structure consists mainly of <LureName><Random\n_Number><Date_Code>.ext.

IOCs for second stage infections\n\n## QAKBOT Infrastructure\n\n### QAKBOT tiered C&C infrastructure\n\nQAKBOT uses a tiered (layered) network of C&C servers, which\nmeans that intermediary layers of servers facilitate\ncommunication with the C&C back end.\n\nTier 1 is the core infrastructure, and is also the botnet back\nend. Tier 3 proxies relay C&C server communication to\nthe real C&C servers represented in the diagram as Tier\n2. Tier 3 proxies get blocked quickly, so they are rotated\nin the malware configuration and change frequently.\n\nThis architecture shields the true location of back-end\nproxies from security researchers and law enforcement.\n\nHere is a list of TCP ports used in C&C communication by the\nQAKBOT core and plug-ins 22, 80, 443, 995, 1194, 2078, 2087,\n2222, 3389, 8443, 32100.\n\n\n-----\n\n### QAKBOT C&C infrastructure by autonomous system \n\nWe found that almost 25% of QAKBOT Tier 3 C&C server infrastructure can be associated with\na single Autonomous System Number (ASN).
