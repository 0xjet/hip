This instruction:\n\na. Reissues and renames DoD Directive (DoDD) 8500.01E (Reference (a)) as a DoD\nInstruction (DoDI) pursuant to the authority in DoDD 5144.02 (Reference (b)) to establish a\nDoD cybersecurity program to protect and defend DoD information and information technology\n(IT).\n\nb. Incorporates and cancels DoDI 8500.02 (Reference (c)), DoDD C-5200.19 (Reference\n(d)), DoDI 8552.01 (Reference (e)), Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and\nInformation Integration (ASD(NII))/DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) Memorandums\n(References (f) through (k)), and Directive-type Memorandum (DTM) 08-060 (Reference (l)).\n\nc. Establishes the positions of DoD principal authorizing official (PAO) (formerly known as\nprincipal accrediting authority) and the DoD Senior Information Security Officer (SISO)\n(formerly known as the Senior Information Assurance Officer) and continues the DoD\nInformation Security Risk Management Committee (DoD ISRMC) (formerly known as the\nDefense Information Systems Network (DISN)/Global Information Grid (GIG) Flag Panel).\n\nd. Adopts the term “cybersecurity” as it is defined in National Security Presidential\nDirective-54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive-23 (Reference (m)) to be used throughout\nDoD instead of the term “information assurance (IA).”\n\n2. APPLICABILITY\n\na. This instruction applies to:\n\n(1) OSD, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff (CJCS) and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General\nof the DoD, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities\nwithin the DoD (referred to collectively in this instruction as the “DoD Components”).\n\n\n-----\n\n(2) All DoD IT.\n\n(3) All DoD information in electronic format.\n\n(4) Special access program (SAP) information technology, other than SAP ISs handling\nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) material.\n\nb. Nothing in this instruction alters or supersedes the existing authorities and policies of the\nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) regarding the protection of SCI as directed by Executive\nOrder 12333 (Reference (n)) and other laws and regulations.\n\n3. POLICY. It is DoD policy that:\n\na. Risk Management\n\n(1) DoD will implement a multi-tiered cybersecurity risk management process to protect\nU.S. interests, DoD operational capabilities, and DoD individuals, organizations, and assets from\nthe DoD Information Enterprise level, through the DoD Component level, down to the IS level\nas described in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)\n800-39 (Reference (o)) and Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy (CNSSP)\n22 (Reference (p)).\n\n(2) Risks associated with vulnerabilities inherent in IT, global sourcing and distribution,\nand adversary threats to DoD use of cyberspace must be considered in DoD employment of\ncapabilities to achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations.\n\n(3) All DoD IT will be assigned to, and governed by, a DoD Component cybersecurity\nprogram that manages risk commensurate with the importance of supported missions and the\nvalue of potentially affected information or assets.\n\n(4) Risk management will be addressed as early as possible in the acquisition of IT and\nin an integrated manner across the IT life cycle.\n\n(5) Documentation regarding the security posture of DoD IS and PIT systems will be\nmade available to promote reciprocity as described in DoDI 8510.01 (Reference (q)) and to assist\nauthorizing officials (AOs) (formerly known as designated approving or accrediting authorities)\nfrom other organizations in making credible, risk-based decisions regarding the acceptance and\nuse of systems and the information that they process, store, or transmit.\n\nb. Operational Resilience. DoD IT will be planned, developed, tested, implemented,\nevaluated, and operated to ensure that:\n\n(1) Information and services are available to authorized users whenever and wherever\nrequired according to mission needs, priorities, and changing roles and responsibilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n(2) Security posture, from individual device or software object to aggregated systems of\nsystems, is sensed, correlated, and made visible to mission owners, network operators, and to the\nDoD Information Enterprise consistent with DoDD 8000.01 (Reference (r)).\n\n(3) Whenever possible, technology components (e.g., hardware and software) have the\nability to reconfigure, optimize, self-defend, and recover with little or no human intervention.\nAttempts made to reconfigure, self-defend, and recover should produce an incident audit trail.\n\nc. Integration and Interoperability\n\n(1) Cybersecurity must be fully integrated into system life cycles and will be a visible\nelement of organizational, joint, and DoD Component IT portfolios.\n\n(2) Interoperability will be achieved through adherence to DoD architecture principles,\nadopting a standards-based approach, and by all DoD Components sharing the level of risk\nnecessary to achieve mission success.\n\n(3) All interconnections of DoD IT will be managed to minimize shared risk by ensuring\nthat the security posture of one system is not undermined by vulnerabilities of interconnected\nsystems.\n\nd. Cyberspace Defense. Cyberspace defense will be employed to protect, detect,\ncharacterize, counter, and mitigate unauthorized activity and vulnerabilities on DoD information\nnetworks. Cyberspace defense information will be shared with all appropriately cleared and\nauthorized personnel in support of DoD enterprise-wide situational awareness.\n\ne. Performance\n\n(1) Implementation of cybersecurity will be overseen and governed through the\nintegrated decision structures and processes described in this instruction.\n\n(2) Performance will be measured, assessed for effectiveness, and managed relative to\ncontributions to mission outcomes and strategic goals and objectives, in accordance with\nSections 11103 and 11313 of Title 40, United States Code (U.S.C.) (Reference (s)).\n\n(3) Data will be collected to support reporting and cybersecurity management activities\nacross the system life cycle.\n\n(4) Standardized IT tools, methods, and processes will be used to the greatest extent\npossible to eliminate duplicate costs and to focus resources on creating technologically mature\nand verified solutions.\n\nf. DoD Information. All DoD information in electronic format will be given an appropriate\nlevel of confidentiality, integrity, and availability that reflects the importance of both information\nsharing and protection.\n\n\n-----\n\ng. Identity Assurance\n\n(1) Identity assurance must be used to ensure strong identification, authentication, and\neliminate anonymity in DoD IS and PIT systems.\n\n(2) DoD will public key-enable DoD ISs and implement a DoD-wide Public Key\nInfrastructure (PKI) solution that will be managed by the DoD PKI Program Management Office\nin accordance with DoDI 8520.02 (Reference (t)).\n\n(3) Biometrics used in support of identity assurance will be managed in accordance with\nDoDD 8521.01 (Reference (u)).\n\nh. Information Technology\n\n(1) All IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, or transmits DoD information will be\nacquired, configured, operated, maintained, and disposed of consistent with applicable DoD\ncybersecurity policies, standards, and architectures.\n\n(2) Risks associated with global sourcing and distribution, weaknesses or flaws inherent\nin the IT, and vulnerabilities introduced through faulty design, configuration, or use will be\nmanaged, mitigated, and monitored as appropriate.\n\n(3) Cybersecurity requirements must be identified and included throughout the lifecycle\nof systems including acquisition, design, development, developmental testing, operational\ntesting, integration, implementation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all DoD IT supporting\nDoD tasks and missions.\n\ni. Cybersecurity Workforce\n\n(1) Cybersecurity workforce functions must be identified and managed, and personnel\nperforming cybersecurity functions will be appropriately screened in accordance with this\ninstruction and DoD 5200.2-R (Reference (v)), and qualified in accordance with DoDD 8570.01\n(Reference (w)) and supporting issuances.\n\n(2) Qualified cybersecurity personnel must be identified and integrated into all phases of\nthe system development life cycle.\n\nj. Mission Partners\n\n(1) Capabilities built to support cybersecurity objectives that are shared with mission\npartners will be consistent with guidance contained in Reference (r) and governed through\nintegrated decision structures and processes described in this instruction.\n\n\n-----\n\n(2) DoD-originated and DoD-provided information residing on mission partner ISs must\nbe properly and adequately safeguarded, with documented agreements indicating required levels\nof protection.\n\n4. RESPONSIBILITIES. See Enclosure 2.\n\n5. PROCEDURES. See Enclosure 3.\n\n6. INFORMATION COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS. The DoD Federal Information\nSecurity Management Act (FISMA) Annual Report with Quarterly Updates, referred to in\nparagraphs 1v and 13q of Enclosure 2 and paragraph 12i of Enclosure 3 of this instruction, has\nbeen assigned report control symbol DD-CIO(A,Q)2296 in accordance with the procedures in\nDTM 12-004 (Reference (x)) and DoD 8910.1-M (Reference (y)).\n\n7.

Oversees and ensures timely implementation of international cybersecurity and\ncyberspace defense agreements involving the geographic combatant commands.\n\ne. Oversees DoD cybersecurity inspections as described in CJCSI 6510.01 (Reference (ce))\nand operational risk assessments as described in NIST SP 800-30 (Reference (cf)) to maintain\nand determine compliance with security policy, procedures, and practices.\n\n\n-----\n\nENCLOSURE 3\n\nPROCEDURES\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\na. The purpose of the Defense cybersecurity program is to ensure that IT can be used in a\nway that allows mission owners and operators to have confidence in the confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability of IT and DoD information, and to make choices based on that confidence.\n\nb. The Defense cybersecurity program supports DoD’s vision of effective operations in\ncyberspace where:\n\n(1) DoD missions and operations continue under any cyber situation or condition.\n\n(2) The IT components of DoD weapons systems and other defense platforms perform\nas designed and adequately meet operational requirements.\n\n(3) The DoD Information Enterprise collectively, consistently, and effectively acts in\nits own defense.\n\n(4) DoD has ready access to its information and command and control channels, and\nits adversaries do not.\n\n(5) The DoD Information Enterprise securely and seamlessly extends to mission\npartners.\n\nc. In accordance with DoDD 5105.53 (Reference (cg)), the Director of Administration and\nManagement is responsible for providing policy, oversight, direction, and control, including\nexercise of the authorities of the Secretary of Defense pursuant to chapter 159 of Reference (bh),\nfor the management, operation, security, protection, safety, renovation, construction, and IT of\nthe Pentagon Reservation and supported DoD facilities and space in the National Capital Region,\nincluding the Raven Rock Mountain Complex and alternate sites.\n\n2. RISK MANAGEMENT\n\na. Cybersecurity Risk Management. Managing cybersecurity risks is a complex,\nmultifaceted undertaking that requires the involvement of the entire organization, from senior\nleaders planning and managing DoD operations, to individuals developing, implementing, and\noperating the IT supporting those operations. Cybersecurity risk management is a subset of the\noverall risk management process for all DoD acquisitions as defined in Reference (av), which\nincludes cost, performance, and schedule risk associated with the execution of all programs of\nrecord, and all other acquisitions of DoD. The risk assessment process extends to the logistics\nsupport of fielded equipment and the need to maintain the integrity of supply sources.\n\n\n-----\n\n(1) DoD will use NIST SP 800-37 (Reference (ch)), as implemented by Reference (q), to\naddress risk management, including authorization to operate (ATO), for all DoD ISs and PIT\nsystems.\n\n(2) DoD IS and PIT systems will transition to CNSSI 1253 (Reference (ci)), NIST SP\n800-53 (Reference (cj)), and Reference (ch) in accordance with transition guidance provided in\nReference (q).\n\nb. Integrated Organization-Wide Risk Management. Risk management can be viewed as a\nholistic activity that is fully integrated into every aspect of the organization as described in\nReference (o). Figure 1 illustrates a three-tiered approach to risk management that addresses\nrisk-related concerns at the organization level, the mission and business process level, and the IS\nlevel.\n\nFigure 1. Three-Tiered Approach to Risk Management\n\n**_STRATEGIC RISK_**\n\n - Traceability and Transparency of  - Inter- Tier and Intra-Tier\n\n**Risk-Based Decisions** **TIER** **1** **Communications**\n\n                                           - Feedback Loop for\n\n - Organization-Wide **ORGANIZATION**\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n**Risk Awareness**\n\n**TIER** **2**\n**MISSION / BUSINESS PROCESSES**\n\n**TIER** **3**\n**INFORMATION SYSTEMS**\n\n**_TACTICAL RISK_**\n\n(1) Risk management at Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective. As\npart of the feedback loop, Tier 1 risk management is informed and influenced by risk decisions\nmade in Tiers 2 and 3.\n\n(a) A comprehensive IS security governance structure is established that provides\nassurance that IS security strategies are aligned with and support mission and business\nobjectives, are consistent with applicable laws and regulations through adherence to policies and\ninternal controls, and provide assignment of responsibility.\n\n(b) The DoD ISRMC, comprising the four MA PAOs and other major DoD and IC\nstakeholders, provides the Tier 1 risk management governance for DoD.\n\n\n**_STRATEGIC RISK_**\n\n - Traceability and Transparency of  - Inter- Tier and Intra-Tier\n\n**Risk-Based Decisions** **TIER** **1** **Communications**\n\n                                           - Feedback Loop for\n\n - Organization-Wide **ORGANIZATION**\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n**Risk Awareness**\n\n**TIER** **2**\n**MISSION / BUSINESS PROCESSES**\n\n**TIER** **3**\n**INFORMATION SYSTEMS**\n\n**_TACTICAL RISK_**\n\n\n-----\n\n(2) Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission and business process perspective and is guided\nby the risk decisions at Tier 1, and informed and influenced by risk decisions made in Tier 3.\n\n(a) The activities at Tier 2 begin with the design, development, and implementation\nof the mission and business processes defined at Tier 1.\n\n(b) The PAOs for each DoD MA provide the Tier 2 governance for their respective\nMAs.\n\n(3) Tier 3 addresses risk from an IS and PIT system perspective and is guided by the risk\ndecisions at Tiers 1 and 2.\n\n(a) Though the need for specific protections is identified at Tiers 1 and 2, it is at Tier\n3 where the information protections are applied to the system and its environment of operation\nfor the benefit of successfully enabling mission and business success.\n\n(b) Information protection requirements are satisfied by the selection and\nimplementation of appropriate security controls in Reference (cj). Security controls are\nimplemented at Tier 3 by common control providers, system managers (SMs), or PMs, and riskbased authorization decisions are granted by AOs.\n\nc. Risk Management in the System Development Life Cycle\n\n(1) Risk management tasks begin early in the system development life cycle and are\nimportant in shaping the security capabilities of the IS. If these tasks are not adequately\nperformed during the initiation, development, and acquisition phases of the system development\nlife cycle, the tasks will, by necessity, be undertaken later in the life cycle and will be more\ncostly and time consuming to implement, and could negatively impact the performance of the IS.\n\n(2) Cybersecurity risk management is planned for and documented in a cybersecurity\nstrategy (formerly known as IA strategy) in accordance with References (at) and (av), and\nincluded in the PPP for all acquisition programs. Periodic reviews of the PPP and associated\nsystems engineering documents should evaluate the status of cybersecurity solutions as part of\nthe larger systems development.\n\n(3) Risk management must continue during operations and sustainment. This may\ninclude the application of new or revised security controls prior to the integration of new IT\nservices or products into an existing operational IS in order to maintain the security of the\noperational IS.\n\nd. DoD ISRMC. The DoD ISRMC, supported by the DSAWG, is the DoD risk executive\nfunction as described in References (o) and (ch).\n\ne. Risk Management Framework (RMF). DoD uses Reference (ch) as implemented by\nReference (q), and is applicable to all DoD ISs and PIT systems. The RMF provides a\ndisciplined and structured process that combines IS security and risk management activities into\n\n\n-----\n\nthe system development life cycle and authorizes their use within DoD. The RMF has six steps:\ncategorize system; select security controls; implement security controls; assess security controls;\nauthorize system; and monitor security controls.\n\nf. Risk Assessment. Risk assessment is a key step in the organizational risk management\nprocess. Risk assessments will be performed in accordance with the process in Reference (cf)\nand as described on the Knowledge Service (KS) (i.e., recommending preferred risk assessment\napproaches and analysis approaches). In particular, all of the risk factors described in Reference\n(cf) must be used across components and agencies of the DoD to ensure reciprocity and ease of\nsharing risk information. The robustness of the risk assessments may be tailored to\naccommodate resource constraints and the availability of detailed risk factor information (e.g.,\nthreat data); however, any tailoring must be clearly explained in risk assessment reports to ensure\nthat AOs understand to what degree they can rely on the results of the risk assessments.\n\ng. Security Controls. Security controls are expressed in a specified format (e.g., a control\nnumber, a control name, control text, and enhancement text).\n\n(1) All DoD IS and PIT systems will be categorized in accordance with Reference (ci)\nand will implement a corresponding set of security controls that are published in Reference (cj)\nregardless of whether they are National Security System (NSS) or non-NSS.\n\n(2) All security controls used by DoD are published in the security control catalog in\nReference (cj), with supporting validation procedures in NIST 800-53A (Reference (ck)).\n\n(3) DoD-specific assignment values, implementation guidance, and validation\nprocedures will be developed by the DoD CIO with direct support from NSA/CSS and DISA and\ninput from the other DoD Components and will be published in the KS at\nhttps://diacap.iaportal.navy.mil.\n\n(4) The DoD CIO, with direct support from NSA/CSS and DISA, and input from the\nother DoD Components, works with NIST to ensure that the security control catalog remains upto-date and continues to represent DoD needs.\n\n(5) Detailed guidance on DoD IS and PIT system categorization and security control\nselection is provided in Reference (q).\n\nh. Cybersecurity Reciprocity\n\n(1) Within DoD, reciprocity has been implemented as cybersecurity reciprocity to\ndifferentiate it from the application of reciprocity to other disciplines. Cybersecurity reciprocity\nreduces time and resources wasted on redundant test, assessment and documentation efforts.\n\n(2) Cybersecurity reciprocity is best achieved through transparency (i.e., making\nsufficient evidence regarding the security posture of an IS or PIT system available, so that an AO\nfrom another organization can use that evidence to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding\nthe acceptance and use of that system or the information it processes, stores, or transmits). DoD\n\n\n-----\n\nComponents must share security authorization packages with affected information owners (IOs)\nor stewards and interconnected ISOs to support cybersecurity reciprocity. The reciprocal\nacceptance of DoD and other federal agency and department security authorizations will be\nimplemented in accordance with the procedures in Reference (q).\n\n3. OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE. Operational resilience requires three conditions to be met:\ninformation resources are trustworthy; missions are ready for information resources degradation\nor loss; and network operations have the means to prevail in the face of adverse events.\nOperational resilience must be achieved by:\n\na. Using TSN requirements and best practices to protect mission-critical functions and\ncomponents and manage risks to the integrity of critical information and communications\ntechnology in accordance with Reference (bm) for the sustainment of IT. This includes the use\nof criticality analysis, all-source threat informed acquisition, and engineering mitigations, and the\nauthorities prescribed in section 806 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for\nFiscal Year 2011(Reference (cl)). TSN processes and best practices must be applied early and\nacross the system development life cycle, and be applied to system acquisitions and the purchase\nand integration of replacement IT as described in Reference (bm).\n\nb. Performing developmental T&E of cybersecurity in accordance with Reference (av) and\nOT&E in accordance with References (bc) and (bd), including the ability to detect and react to\npenetrations and exploitations and to protect and restore data and information, in order to inform\nacquisition and fielding decisions.\n\nc. Supporting acquisition program protection by:\n\n(1) Ensuring cybersecurity is a key element of program protection planning activities\nthat manage risks to advance technology and mission-critical system functionality from foreign\ncollection due to design vulnerability or supply chain exploit insertion, and battlefield loss\nthroughout the system life cycle.\n\n(2) Having mission criteria for identifying critical components and critical program\ninformation as established in References (bm) and (ay).\n\nd. Planning for mission continuation in the face of degraded or unavailable information\nresources in accordance with DoDD 3020.26 (Reference (cm)), and integrating those plans and\npriorities into the DoD Information Enterprise.\n\ne. Exercising under realistic cyber conditions and testing procedures and tactics for workarounds and fall-backs in the face of hostility in accordance with Secretary of Defense\nMemorandum (Reference (cn)). This includes:\n\n(1) Conducting periodic exercises or evaluations of the ability to operate during loss of\nall information resources and connectivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n(2) Being able to allocate information resources dynamically as needed to sustain\nmission operations while addressing cyber failures, no matter the cause.\n\n(3) Being able to restore information resources rapidly to a trusted state while\nmaintaining support to ongoing missions.\n\nf. Preserving the trust in the security of DoD information during transmission.\n\n(1) Transmission of DoD information must be protected through the communications\nsecurity (COMSEC) measures and procedures established in DoDI 8523.01 (Reference (co)) and\nsecurity controls that support transmission security (TRANSEC) in Reference (cj).\n\n(2) COMSEC monitoring and cybersecurity readiness testing will be conducted in\naccordance with Reference (bn).\n\n(3) Compromising emanations (i.e., TEMPEST) countermeasures must be applied in\naccordance with policy in Reference (ca), guidance in Reference (cb), and other TEMPEST\nguidance as issued by the DIRNSA/CHCSS.\n\ng. Using automation whenever possible in support of cybersecurity objectives including, but\nnot limited to, secure configuration management, continuous monitoring, active cyber defense,\nand incident reporting and situational awareness.\n\n4. INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY\n\na. Net-Centric Operations. A net-centric model provides people, services, and platforms the\nability to discover one another and connect to form new capabilities or teams without being\nconstrained by geographic, organizational, or technical barriers. The net-centric model allows\npeople, services, and platforms to work together to achieve shared ends. To be net-centric,\ncybersecurity will be designed, organized, and managed such that it can work together in any\ncombination that events demand and maintain an expected level of readiness so that all required\ncybersecurity assets can be brought to bear in a rapid and flexible manner to meet new or\nchanging mission needs.\n\nb. Integration. Cybersecurity must be fully integrated into system life cycles so that it will\nbe a visible element of organizational, joint, and DoD Component architectures, capability\nidentification and development processes, integrated testing, information technology portfolios,\nacquisition, operational readiness assessments, supply chain risk management, SSE, and\noperations and maintenance activities.\n\nc. Interoperability\n\n(1) Cybersecurity products (e.g., firewalls, file integrity checkers, virus scanners,\nintrusion detection systems, anti‐malware software) should operate in a net-centric manner to\nenhance the exchange of data and shared security policies.\n\n\n-----\n\n(2) Semantic, technical, and policy interoperability will be used to integrate disparate\ncybersecurity products into a net-centric enterprise that can work together to create new\nintelligence and make and implement decisions at network speed.\n\n(3) Semantic, technical, and policy interoperability support products are designed to\nprovide security for communications between different IT systems. Interoperable\ncommunications must be consistent with approved cryptographic design and current system\nimplementation standards. The objective is to ensure the seamless and secure exchange of\nclassified or sensitive information that is critical to the success of DoD mission goals and\nobjectives.\n\nd. Standards-Based Approach. The DoD cybersecurity and cyberspace defense data strategy\nwill enable semantic, technical, and policy interoperability through a standards-based approach\nthat has been refined by many in industry, academia, and government. It is an information‐\noriented approach (see for example the security content automation protocol (SCAP) discussion\nin NIST SP 800-126 (Reference (cp)).\n\ne. DoD Architecture Principles. Interoperability and effective management of security\ncontent will be achieved through adherence to DoD cybersecurity architectures as issued. All\nDoD Components must commit to these architectures to facilitate sharing of information\nnecessary to achieve mission success while managing the risk inherent in interconnecting\nsystems.\n\nf. Knowledge Repositories. These contain a broad collection of best practices, benchmarks,\nstandards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and the like. Examples\ninclude the National Vulnerability Database (http://nvd.nist.gov/), the Open Vulnerability and\nAssessment Language Repository (http://oval.mitre.org/repository), and the DoD’s KS as\ndefined in Reference (q). In many respects, knowledge repositories serve as the cybersecurity\nand cyberspace defense community “memory” and they enable policy or process interoperability\nand should be used to share information and answer questions.\n\n5. CYBERSPACE DEFENSE. Cyberspace defense uses architectures, cybersecurity,\nintelligence, counterintelligence (CI), other security programs, LE, and other military capabilities\nto harden the DoD Information Enterprise to be more resistant to penetration and disruption; to\nstrengthen the U.S. ability to respond to unauthorized activity and defend DoD information and\nnetworks against sophisticated and agile cyber threats; and to recover quickly from cyber\nincidents.\n\na. Defense of DoD IT. Defense of DoD IT and information networks is under the direction\nof the Commander, USSTRATCOM, in accordance with Reference (cd) and is conducted as\ndescribed in Commander, USSTRATCOM, orders or other directives such as alerts and\nbulletins, Reference (bl), and DoD Manual O-8530.01 (Reference (cq)). Cyberspace defense is\nintegrated with other elements of network operations as described in DoDI 8410.02 (Reference\n(cr)).\n\n\n-----\n\nb. Continuous Monitoring Capability. DoD will establish and maintain a continuous\nmonitoring capability that provides cohesive collection, transmission, storage, aggregation, and\npresentation of data that conveys current operational status to affected DoD stakeholders. DoD\nComponents will achieve cohesion through the use of a common continuous monitoring\nframework, lexicon, and workflow as specified in NIST SP 800-137 (Reference (cs)).\n\nc. Penetration and Exploitation Testing. Evaluation of cybersecurity during an acquisition\nT&E event must include independent threat representative penetration and exploitation testing\nand evaluation of the complete system cyberspace defenses including the controls and protection\nprovided by computer network defense service providers. Penetration and exploitation testing\nmust be planned and resourced as part of the DT&E and OT&E via the appropriate program test\ndocumentation.\n\nd. Cyber Defense Personnel. Cyber defense personnel operating on or in DoD IS will be\nidentified using identity authentication methods in DoDI 8520.03 (Reference (ct)).\n\ne. LE and CI (LE/CI)\n\n(1) The DoD Cyber Crime Center, as described in DoDD 5505.13 (Reference (cu)),\nprovides digital and multimedia forensics and specialized cyber investigative training and\nservices. In this role it coordinates and facilitates relationships across LE, intelligence, and\nhomeland security communities.\n\n(2) DoD component LE/CI agencies deploy capabilities on DoD networks with the intent\nto identify and investigate the human element posing a threat to DoD IT and DoD information.\nCybersecurity will be used in support of countering espionage, international terrorism, and the CI\ninsider threat in accordance with DoDI 5240.26 (Reference (cv)).\n\n(3) DoD network administrators will accommodate all applicable legitimate and lawful\ndeployment of LE/CI tools and solutions. DoD LE/CI organizations in turn will make all\nreasonable attempts to coordinate the implementation of LE/CI solutions with their respective\nAO in a manner consistent with service-level change control processes in order to avoid any\ndisruption to mission critical operational tempo.\n\nf. Insider Threat. Insider threats must be addressed in accordance with policy and\nprocedures published by the USD(P).\n\n6. PERFORMANCE\n\na. Organizations will implement processes and procedures to accommodate three conditions\nnecessary to realize effective cybersecurity that is consistently implemented across DoD:\n\n(1) Organization Direction. This includes organizational mechanisms for establishing\nand communicating priorities and objectives, principles, policies, standards, and performance\n\n\n-----\n\nmeasures.\n\n(2) A Culture of Accountability. This includes aligning internal processes, maintaining\naccountability, and informing, making, and following through on decisions with implications for\ncyberspace protection and defense.\n\n(3) Insight and Oversight. This includes measuring, reviewing, verifying, monitoring,\nfacilitating, and remediating to ensure coordinated and consistent cybersecurity implementation\nand reporting across all organizations without impeding local missions.\n\nb. In addition to the structures that facilitate DoD’s major decision processes (e.g., the Joint\nChiefs of Staff Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System described in CJCSI\n3170.01 (Reference (cw)), DoDD 7045.14 (Reference (cx)), Reference (au)) cybersecurity\nperformance is facilitated by the DoD CIO Executive Board in accordance with the DoD CIO\nMemorandum (Reference (cy)) and its supporting governance bodies (e.g., IA Senior Leadership\nforum, DoD ISRMC).\n\nc. Strategic cybersecurity metrics will be defined, collected, and reported by the DoD CIO in\npartnership with the DoD Components. DoD CIO will develop and issue guidance regarding\nhow cybersecurity metrics are determined, established, defined, collected, and reported.\n\n7. DoD INFORMATION\n\na. The DoD Information Security Program is described in DoDI 5200.01 (Reference (cz)).\nAll classified information and CUI must be protected in accordance with References (bs), (by),\n(bo), and (bp).\n\nb. DoD’s information sharing policies and procedures are defined in DoDD 8320.02\n(Reference (da)) and DoD 8320.02-G (Reference (db)). Information sharing actions and\nactivities will be aligned with the DoD Information Sharing Operational Strategy and Guidance\n(see www.dodcio.defense.gov). A security clearance held is an attribute of any identified DoD\nperson, and that attribute should be discovered and considered when a decision is made to share\nclassified information. If the information intended to be shared is not classified, then other\nattributes associated with the identity of the sharing recipient may need to be discovered before\nthe sharing is executed.\n\nc. The Defense cybersecurity program provides the mechanisms to measure, monitor, and\nenforce information security and sharing policies and procedures as they relate to information in\nan electronic form, primarily through the implementation of security controls.\n\nd. Information systems must protect classified information and CUI from unauthorized\naccess by requiring authentication in accordance with Reference (ct) prior to making an access\ndecision.\n\n\n-----\n\ne. All unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release in\naccordance with DoDD 5230.09 (Reference (dc)) and that is in the possession or control of nonDoD entities on non-DoD ISs must be protected in accordance with DoDI 8582.01 (Reference\n(dd)).\n\nf. Classified information and export controlled unclassified information released or disclosed\nto industry in connection with contracts under the National Industrial Security Program must be\nprotected in accordance with Reference (bj).\n\ng. Spillage of classified information onto an unclassified IS, of higher-level classified\ninformation onto a lower level classified IS, or of classified information onto an IS not\nauthorized to the appropriate level must be handled in accordance with Reference (bo).\n\nh. To enable automated sharing and protection, all DoD information must include marking\nand metadata as required by References (bp), (bs) and (da), and that information must be in the\nformat specified in References (bp) and (by).\n\ni. DoD IT that processes or stores PII or protected health information must comply with\nReference (bq), DoDI 5400.16 (Reference (de)), and DoD 8580.02-R (Reference (df)).\n\nj. In accordance with Reference (de), a privacy impact assessment (PIA) is required for DoD\nISs that collect, maintain, use, or disseminate PII about members of the public, federal personnel,\ncontractors, or foreign nationals (FNs) employed at U.S. military facilities internationally.\n\nk. All non-DoD entities that process unclassified DoD information on non-DoD ISs, to the\nextent provided by the applicable contract, grant, or other legal agreement or understanding with\nDoD, must comply with applicable Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplements and\nwill comply with Reference (dd), and, if a cleared contractor, with Reference (bj).\n\nl. Unclassified DoD information in the possession of the DIB will be protected by\nconducting DIB cybersecurity as established in Reference (ad), and cleared contractor facilities\nwill be protected in accordance with Reference (bj).\n\nm. Cryptography required to protect DoD information will be implemented in accordance\nwith Reference (bi).\n\nn. DoD information proposed or projected for publication on public Internet media (e.g.,\nwebsite, blog, social media) must be reviewed and approved for public dissemination in\naccordance with Reference (dc), DoD Manual 5205.02 (Reference (dg)), and DoDI 8550.01\n(Reference (dh)).\n\n8. IDENTITY ASSURANCE\n\na. Identity assurance ensures strong identification and authentication, and eliminates\nanonymity in DoD ISs so that entities’ access and access behavior are visible, traceable, and\n\n\n-----\n\nenable continuous monitoring for LE and cybersecurity. Person and non-person entity identity\npolicies, standards, information, infrastructure, issuance, and revocation processes and\nprocedures that bind the physical and digital representations of entities will incorporate measures\nto ensure the integrity, authenticity, security, privacy, and availability of authoritative identity\ninformation across the full spectrum of DoD mission environments and operations.\n\n(1) DoD ISs will use only DoD-approved identity credentials to authenticate entities\nrequesting access to or within the Defense information environment. This requirement extends\nto all mission partners using DoD ISs.\n\n(2) The identification of entities accessing DoD ISs must be recorded in order to deny\nanonymity and deter abuse of authorized IS access. DoD will implement capabilities to record,\ntrack, and monitor specific entity access to networks, applications, and web servers.\n\nb. DoD IS will employ identity assurance procedures that are aligned with the DoD Identity\nManagement Strategic Plan and the Identity Assurance Implementation Guidance and Roadmap\nto the extent practical.\n\nc. Information and infrastructure that support identity reliant functions, processes, and\nprocedures used in support of DoD operations, including but not limited to identity credentialing,\nwill incorporate measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and availability of\nidentity data or identity credentials.\n\nd. Identity assurance policies and procedures regarding identity authentication for ISs are in\nReference (ct).\n\n9. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n\na. IT. Cybersecurity applies to all IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, or transmits\nDoD information, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. DoD Information Technology\n\n(1) Information Systems. Cybersecurity requirements must be identified and included in\nthe design, development, acquisition, installation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all DoD\nISs in accordance with section 3544 of Reference (aa), References (q) and (r), section 2224 of\nReference (bh), this instruction, and other cybersecurity-related DoD guidance, as issued.\n\n(a) DoD ISs are typically organized in one of two forms:\n\n1. Enclave\n\na. Enclaves provide standard cybersecurity, such as boundary defense,\nincident detection and response, and key management, and also deliver common applications,\nsuch as office automation and electronic mail. Enclaves may be specific to an organization or a\nmission, and the computing environments may be organized by physical proximity or by\nfunction independent of location. Examples of enclaves include local area networks and the\napplications they host, backbone networks, and data processing centers.\n\nb. Enclaves always assume the highest security category of the ISs that they\nhost, and derive their security needs from those systems. See Reference (ch) for a discussion of\nIS boundaries and the application of security controls.\n\n2. Major Application (Formerly Automated Information System Application)\n\na. Certain applications, because of the information in them, require special\nmanagement oversight due to the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse,\nor unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application and should be\ntreated as major applications. A major application may be a single software application (e.g.,\nintegrated consumable items support); multiple software applications that are related to a single\nmission (e.g., payroll or personnel); or a combination of software and hardware performing a\nspecific support function across a range of missions (e.g., Global Command and Control System,\nDefense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System).\n\n\n-----\n\nb. Major applications include any application that is a product or deliverable\nof an Acquisition Category I through III program as defined in Enclosure 3 of Reference (av).\nWhen operationally feasible all new major applications will be hosted in a Defense Enterprise\nComputing Center.\n\nc. All applications, regardless of whether they rise to the level of major\napplication or not, require an appropriate level of protection. Adequate security for other than\nmajor applications may be provided by security of the environment in which they operate.\n\nd. When possible, capabilities should be developed as applications hosted in\nexisting authorized computing environments (i.e., enclaves) rather than designated as major\napplications requiring new and separate authorizations.\n\ne. DoD Component CIOs will resolve disputes regarding whether an\napplication rises to the level of a major application.\n\n(b) DoD IS Registration. All DoD ISs will be registered in the DITPR (at\nhttps://ditpr.dod.mil/) or the SITR (at http://dodcio.osd.smil.mil/itregistry) in accordance with\ncurrent DITPR and SITR guidance, or with the DoD Component SAPCO for SAP ISs. New\nDoD ISs should be entered into the DITPR or SITR at the beginning of the system development\nlife cycle.\n\n(c) Stand-Alone Systems. DoD ISs and PIT systems that are stand-alone must be\nauthorized to operate, but assigned security control sets may be tailored as appropriate with the\napproval of the AO (e.g., network-related controls may be eliminated).\n\n(d) Notice and Consent Banners. Standard mandatory notice and consent banners\nmust be displayed at logon to all ISs and standard mandatory notice and consent provisions will\nbe included in all DoD IS user agreements in accordance with applicable security controls and\nDoD implementation procedures in the KS. Official DoD standard notice and consent language\nwill be posted on the KS with copies posted to the IASE.\n\n(2) PIT\n\n(a) All PIT has cybersecurity considerations. The Defense cybersecurity program\nonly addresses the protection of the IT included in the platform. See Reference (q) for PIT\ncybersecurity requirements.\n\n(b) Examples of platforms that may include PIT are: weapons systems, training\nsimulators, diagnostic test and maintenance equipment, calibration equipment, equipment used in\nthe research and development of weapons systems, medical devices and health information\ntechnologies, vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles (e.g., electric, bio-fuel, Liquid Natural Gas\nthat contain car-computers), buildings and their associated control systems (building automation\nsystems or building management systems, energy management system, fire and life safety,\nphysical security, elevators, etc.), utility distribution systems (such as electric, water, waste\n\n\n-----\n\nwater, natural gas and steam), telecommunications systems designed specifically for industrial\ncontrol systems including supervisory control and data acquisition, direct digital control,\nprogrammable logic controllers, other control devices and advanced metering or sub-metering,\nincluding associated data transport mechanisms (e.g., data links, dedicated networks).\n\n(c) Cybersecurity requirements must be identified, tailored appropriately, and\nincluded in the acquisition, design, development, developmental and operational testing and\nevaluation, integration, implementation, operation, upgrade, or replacement of all DoD PIT in\naccordance with References (bm) and (ay), this instruction, and other cybersecurity-related DoD\nguidance, as issued.\n\n(d) Owners of special purpose systems (i.e., platforms), in consultation with an AO,\nmay determine that a collection of PIT rises to the level of a PIT system.\n\n1.  PIT systems are analogous to enclaves but are dedicated only to the platforms\nthey support. PIT systems must be designated as such by the responsible OSD or DoD\nComponent heads or their delegates and authorized by an AO specifically appointed to authorize\nPIT systems.\n\n2. All DoD PIT systems will be categorized as defined in Reference (ci) and\nauthorized in accordance with Reference (q).\n\n3. Although other federal departments and agencies may treat PIT systems as a\ntype of IS, DoD platforms supporting certain DoD missions have unique operational and security\nneeds.

An IT Service consists of a combination of people, processes, and technology.\n\nkey management infrastructure. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nmajor application. An application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and\nmagnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification\nof the information in the application. All federal applications require some level of protection.\nCertain applications, because of the information in them, however, require special management\noversight and should be treated as major. Adequate security for other applications should be\nprovided by security of the systems in which they operate. (Reference (al))\n\nMA. Defined in Reference (ac).\n\nmission partners. Defined in Reference (r).\n\nmobile code. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nmobile code risk categories. Categories of risk associated with mobile code technology based on\nfunctionality, level of access to workstation, server, and remote system services and resources,\nand the resulting threat to information systems.\n\nNSS. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nnetwork. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\n\n-----\n\noperational resilience. The ability of systems to resist, absorb, and recover from or adapt to an\nadverse occurrence during operation that may cause harm, destruction, or loss of ability to\nperform mission-related functions.\n\noverlay. Defined in Reference (ci).\n\nPIA. Defined in Reference (de).\n\nPIT. IT, both hardware and software, that is physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in real\ntime to the mission performance of special purpose systems.\n\nPIT system. A collection of PIT within an identified boundary under the control of a single\nauthority and security policy. The systems may be structured by physical proximity or by\nfunction, independent of location.\n\npolicy interoperability. Common business processes related to the transmission, receipt, and\nacceptance of data among participants.\n\nprivileged user. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nprivate DoD internet service. Defined in Reference (dh).\n\nPM or SM. The individual with responsibility for and authority to accomplish program or\nsystem objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s operational\nneeds.\n\nPPP. Defined in Reference (ay).\n\npublic key enabling. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nreciprocity. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nRed Team. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nrisk executive function. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nsecurity category. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nsecurity control assessor. Defined in Reference (ch).\n\nsecurity controls. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nsecurity posture. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nsemantic interoperability. The ability of each sending party to communicate data and have\nreceiving parties understand the message in the sense intended by the sending party.\n\n\n-----\n\nSISO. See “Senior (Agency) Information Security Officer” definition in Reference (ch). The\nSISO role, as described in law (Reference (aa)) and by NIST, should not be confused with\ninformation security roles and responsibilities within References (bo), (bp), (bs), (by), and (cz).\n\nSRG. Compilation of CCIs grouped in more applicable, specific technology areas at various\nlevels of technology and product specificity. Contain all requirements that have been flagged as\napplicable from the parent level regardless if they are selected on a DoD baseline or not.\n\nSSE. See “IS security engineering” definition in Reference (dz).\n\nstand-alone system. System that is not connected to any other network and does not transmit,\nreceive, route, or exchange information outside of the system’s authorization boundary.\n\nSTIG. Based on DoD policy and security controls. Implementation guide geared to a specific\nproduct and version. Contains all requirements that have been flagged as applicable for the\nproduct which have been selected on a DoD baseline.\n\nsupply chain risk. Defined in Reference (bm).\n\nsystem development life cycle. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\ntechnical interoperability. The ability for different technologies to communicate and exchange\ndata based on well-defined and widely adopted interface standards.\n\nTEMPEST. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nTRANSEC. Defined in Reference (dz).\n\nTPM. The TPM is a microcontroller that stores keys, passwords, and digital certificates. It\ntypically is affixed to the motherboard of computers. It potentially can be used in any computing\ndevice that requires these functions. The nature of this hardware chip ensures that the\ninformation stored there is made more secure from external software attack and physical theft.\nThe TPM standard is a product of the Trusted Computing Group consortium. For more\ninformation on the TPM specification and architecture, refer to\nwww.trustedcomputinggroup.org/groups/tpm.\n\nUCDMO CDS Baseline List. A list managed by the UCDMO that identifies CDSs that are\navailable for deployment within the DoD and IC.\n\nUCDMO CDS Sunset List. A list managed by the UCDMO that identifies CDSs that are or have\nbeen in operation but are no longer available for additional deployment and need to be replaced\nwithin a specified period of time.\n\n\n-----",
