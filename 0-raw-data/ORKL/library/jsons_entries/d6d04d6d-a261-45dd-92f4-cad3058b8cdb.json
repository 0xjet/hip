The attackers behind Epic Turla have infected several hundred computers in\n\nmore than 45 countries, including government institutions, embassies, military, education, research and\n\npharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe attacks are known to have used at least two zero-day exploits:\n\n**[CVE-2013-5065 - Privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows XP and Windows 2003](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-5065)**\n\n**[CVE-2013-3346 - Arbitrary code-execution vulnerability in Adobe Reader](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-3346)**\n\nWe also observed exploits against older (patched) vulnerabilities, social engineering techniques and\n\nwatering hole strategies in these attacks. The primary backdoor used in the Epic attacks is also known as\n\n\"WorldCupSec\", \"TadjMakhal\", \"Wipbot\" or \"Tavdig\".\n\n[When G-Data published on Turla/Uroburos back in February, several questions remained unanswered.](https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/uroburos-highly-complex-espionage-software-with-russian-roots.html)\n\nOne big unknown was the infection vector for Turla (aka Snake or Uroburos). Our analysis indicates that\n\nvictims are infected via a sophisticated multi-stage attack, which begins with the Epic Turla. In time, as\n\nthe attackers gain confidence, this is upgraded to more sophisticated backdoors, such as the\n\nCarbon/Cobra system. Sometimes, both backdoors are run in tandem, and used to \"rescue\" each other if\n\ncommunications are lost with one of the backdoors.\n\nOnce the attackers obtain the necessary credentials without the victim noticing, they deploy the rootkit\n\nand other extreme persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe attacks are still ongoing as of July 2014, actively targeting users in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n**_Note: A full analysis of the Epic attacks is available to the Kaspersky Intelligent Services_**\n\n**_[subscribers. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)_**\n\n## The Epic Turla attacks\n\nThe attacks in this campaign fall into several different categories depending on the vector used in the\n\ninitial compromise:\n\nSpearphishing e-mails with Adobe PDF exploits (CVE-2013-3346 + CVE-2013-5065)\n\n\n-----\n\nsometimes packed with RAR\n\nWatering hole attacks using Java exploits (CVE-2012-1723), Flash exploits (unknown) or Internet\n\nExplorer 6,7,8 exploits (unknown)\n\nWatering hole attacks that rely on social engineering to trick the user into running fake \"Flash\n\nPlayer\" malware installers\n\nThe attackers use both direct spearphishing and watering hole attacks to infect their victims. Watering\n\nholes (waterholes) are websites of interest to the victims that have been compromised by the attackers and\n\ninjected to serve malicious code.\n\nSo far we haven't been able to locate any e-mail used against the victims, only the attachments. The PDF\n\nattachments do not show any \"lure\" to the victim when opened, however, the SCR packages sometime\n\nshow a clean PDF upon successful installation.\n\nSome of known attachment names used in the spearphishing attacks are:\n\n**ﺟﻨ\"ﻒ** **(ﺗﻤﺮ.rar (translation from Arabic: \"Geneva conference.rar\")**\n\n**NATO position on Syria.scr**\n\n**Note_№107-41D.pdf**\n\n**Talking Points.scr**\n\n**border security protocol rar**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Program.scr**\n\nIn some cases, these filenames can provide clues about the type of victims the attackers are targeting.\n\n## The watering hole attacks\n\nCurrently, the Epic attackers run a vast network of watering holes that target visitors with surgical\n\nprecision.\n\nSome of the injected websites include:\n\n_The website of the City Hall of Pinor, Spain_\n\n\n-----\n\n_A site promoting entrepreneurship in the border area of Romania_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Palestinian Authority Ministry of Foreign Affairs_\n\nIn total, we observed more than 100 injected websites. Currently, the largest number of injected sites is in\n\nRomania.\n\nHere's a statistic on the injected websites:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe distribution is obviously not random, and it reflects some of the interests of the attackers. For\n\ninstance, in Romania many of the infected sites are in the Mures region, while many of the Spanish\n\ninfected sites belong to local governments (City Hall).\n\n[Most of the infected sites use the TYPO3 CMS (see: http://typo3.org/), which could indicate the attackers](http://typo3.org/)\n\nare abusing a specific vulnerability in this publishing platform.\n\nInjected websites load a remote JavaScript into the victim's browser:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script \"sitenavigatoin.js\" is a Pinlady-style browser and plugin detection script, which in turn,\n\nredirects to a PHP script sometimes called main.php or wreq.php. Sometimes, the attackers register the\n\n.JPG extension with the PHP handler on the server, using \"JPG\" files to run PHP scripts:\n\n_Profiling script_\n\nThe main exploitation script \"wreq.php\", \"main.php\" or \"main.jpg\" performs a numbers of tasks. We have\n\nlocated several versions of this script which attempt various exploitation mechanisms.\n\nOne version of this script attempts to exploit Internet Explorer versions 6, 7 and 8:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Internet Explorer exploitation script_\n\nUnfortunately, the Internet Explorer exploits have not yet been retrieved.\n\nAnother more recent version attempts to exploit Oracle Sun Java and Adobe Flash Player:\n\n_Java and Flash Player exploitation scripts_\n\nAlthough the Flash Player exploits couldn't be retrieved, we did manage to obtain the Java exploits:\n\n**Name** **MD5**\nallj.html 536eca0defc14eff0a38b64c74e03c79\nallj.jar f41077c4734ef27dec41c89223136cf8\nallj64.html 15060a4b998d8e288589d31ccd230f86\nallj64.jar e481f5ea90d684e5986e70e6338539b4\nlstj.jar 21cbc17b28126b88b954b3b123958b46\nlstj.html acae4a875cd160c015adfdea57bd62c4\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload dropped by these Java exploits is the following:\n\n**MD5: d7ca9cf72753df7392bfeea834bcf992**\n\nThe Java exploit use a special loader that attempts to inject the final Epic backdoor payload into\n\nexplorer.exe. The backdoor extracted from the Java exploits has the following C&C hardcoded inside:\n\n**www.arshinmalalan[.]com/themes/v6/templates/css/in.php**\n\nThis C&C is still online at the moment although it redirects to a currently suspended page at\n\n[\"hxxp://busandcoachdirectory.com[.]au\". For a full list of C&C servers, please see the Appendix.](https://securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_Epic_Turla_Technical_Appendix_20140806.pdf)\n\nThe Epic Turla attackers are extremely dynamic in using exploits or different methods depending on what\n\nis available at the moment. Most recently, we observed them using yet another technique coupled with\n\nwatering hole attacks. This takes advantage of social engineering to trick the user into running a fake\n\nFlash Player (MD5: 030f5fdb78bfc1ce7b459d3cc2cf1877):\n\nIn at least one case, they tried to trick the user into downloading and running a fake Microsoft Security\n\nEssentials app (MD5: 89b0f1a3a667e5cd43f5670e12dba411):\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fake application is signed by a valid digital certificate from Sysprint AG:\n\nSerial number: 00 c0 a3 9e 33 ec 8b ea 47 72 de 4b dc b7 49 bb 95 Thumbprint: 24 21 58 64 f1 28 97 2b 26\n\n22 17 2d ee 62 82 46 07 99 ca 46\n\n_Valid signature from Sysprint AG on Epic dropper_\n\n\n-----\n\n**hxxp://mfa[.]tj/upload/security.php .**\n\nThe file is a .NET application that contains an encrypted resource. This drops the malicious file with the\n\nMD5 7731d42b043865559258464fe1c98513.\n\nThis is an Epic backdoor which connects to the following C&Cs, with a generic internal ID of 1156fd22\n**3443-4344-c4ffff:**\n\n**hxxp://homaxcompany[.]com/components/com_sitemap/**\n**hxxp://www.hadilotfi[.]com/wp-content/themes/profile/**\n\nA full list with all the C&C server URLs that we recovered from the samples can be found in the technical\n\n[Appendix.](https://securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_Epic_Turla_Technical_Appendix_20140806.pdf)\n\n## The Epic command-and-control infrastructure\n\nThe Epic backdoors are commanded by a huge network of hacked servers that deliver  command and\n\ncontrol functionality.\n\nThe huge network commanded by the Epic Turla attackers serves multiple purposes. For instance, the\n\nmotherships function as both exploitation sites and command and control panels for the malware.\n\nHere's how the big picture looks like:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Epic Turla lifecycle_\n\nThe first level of command and control proxies generally talk to a second level of proxies, which in turn,\n\ntalk to the \"mothership\" server. The mothership server is generally a VPS, which runs the Control panel\n\nsoftware used to interact with the victims. The attackers operate the mothership using a network of\n\nproxies and VPN servers for anonymity reasons. The mothership also work as the exploitation servers\n\nused in the watering hole attacks, delivering Java, IE or fake applications to the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt runs a control panel which is password protected:\n\n_Epic mothership control panel login_\n\nOnce logged into the Control panel, the attackers can see a general overview of the system including the\n\nnumber of interesting potential targets:\n\n_Epic control panel status overview_\n\nA very interesting file on the servers is task.css, where the attackers define the IP ranges they are\n\ninterested in. To change the file, they are using the \"Task editor\" from the menu. Depending on the\n\n\"tasks\", they will decide whether to infect the visitors or not. In this case, we found they targeted two\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Country A\" - Federal Government Network\n\n\"Country B\" - Government Telecommunications and Informatics Services Network\n\nIt should be noted though, the fact that the attackers were targeting these ranges doesn't necessarily mean\n\nthey also got infected. Some other unknown IPs were also observed in the targeting schedules.\n\nThere is also an \"except.css\" file where attackers log the reasons they didn't try to exploit certain visitors.\n\nThere are three possible values:\n\nTRY\n\nDON'T TRY -> Version of the browser and OS does not meet the conditions\n\nDON'T TRY -> (2012-09-19 10:02:04) - checktime < 60\n\nThese are the \"don't meet the conditions\" reasons observed in the logs:\n\nWindows 7 or 2008 R2\n\nMSIE 8.0\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR\n\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\nAdobe Shockwave 11.5.1.601\n\nAdobe Flash 10.3.181.14\n\nAdobe Reader 10.1.0.0\n\nWin Media Player 12.0.7601.17514\n\nQuick Time null\n\nMS Word null\n\nJava null\n\n## The Epic / Tavdig / Wipbot backdoor\n\nFor this first stage of the attack, the threat actor uses a custom backdoor. In some cases, the backdoor is\n\npackaged together with the CVE-2013-5065 EoP exploit and heavily obfuscated. This makes the analysis\n\nmore difficult.\n\nThe CVE-2013-5065 exploit allows the backdoor to achieve administrator privileges on the system and run\n\nunrestricted. This exploit only works on unpatched Microsoft Windows XP systems.\n\nOther known detection names for the backdoor is Trojan.Wipbot (Symantec) or Tavdig.\n\nThe main backdoor is about 60KB in size and implements a C&C protocol on top of normal HTTP\n\n\n-----\n\nrequests in the C&C replies, which the malware decrypts and processes. The replies are sent back to the\n\nC&C through the same channel.\n\nThe malware behavior is defined by a configuration block. The configuration block usually contains two\n\nhard-coded C&C URLs. He have also seen one case where the configuration block contains just one URL.\n\nThe configuration can also be updated on the fly by the attackers, via the C&C.\n\nThe backdoor attempts to identify the following processes and, if found, it will terminate itself:\n\ntcpdump.exe\n\nwindump.exe\n\nethereal.exe\n\nwireshark.exe\n\nettercap.exe\n\nsnoop.exe\n\ndsniff.exe\n\nIt contains an internal unique ID, which is used to identify the victim to the C&C. Most samples, especially\n\nold ones, have the ID 1156fd22-3443-4344-c4ffff. Once a victim is confirmed as \"interesting\", the\n\nattackers upload another Epic backdoor which has a unique ID used to control this specific victim.\n\nDuring the first C&C call, the backdoor sends a pack with the victim's system information. All further\n\ninformation sent to the C&C is encrypted with a public key framework, making decryption impossible. The\n\ncommands from the C&C are encrypted in a simpler manner and can be decrypted if intercepted because\n\nthe secret key is hardcoded in the malware.\n\nThrough monitoring, we were able to capture a large amount of commands sent to the victims by the\n\nattackers, providing an unique view into this operation. Here's a look at one of the encrypted server\n\nreplies:\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a victim is infected and \"checks in\" with the server, the attackers send a template of commands:\n\nNext, the attackers try to move through the victim's network using pre-defined or collected passwords:\n\n\n-----\n\nListing all .doc files recursively is also a common \"theme\":\n\nIn total, we have decoded several hundreds of these command packages delivered to the victims, providing\n\nan unique insight into the inner workings of the attackers.\n\nIn addition to generic searches, some very specific lookups have been observed as well. These include\n\nsearches for:\n\n***NATO*.msg**\n\n**eu energy dialogue*.***\n\n**EU*.msg**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, the attackers were interested to find e-mails related to \"NATO\", \"Energy Dialogue within\n\nEuropean Unition\" and so on.\n\nFor some of the C&C servers, the attackers implemented RSA encryption for the C&C logs, which makes it\n\nimpossible to decrypt them. This scheme was implemented in April 2014.\n\n## Lateral movement and upgrade to more sophisticated backdoors\n\nOnce a victim is compromised, the attackers upload several tools that are used for lateral movement.\n\nOne such tool observed in the attacks and saved as \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\All users\\Start\n\n**Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\winsvclg.exe\" is:**\n\n**Name: winsvclg.exe**\n**MD5: a3cbf6179d437909eb532b7319b3dafe**\n**Compiled: Tue Oct 02 13:51:50 2012**\n\nThis is a keylogger tool that creates %temp%\\~DFD3O8.tmp. Note: the filename can change across\n\nvictims. On one Central Asian government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs victim system, the filename used\n\nwas \"adobe32updt.exe\".\n\nIn addition to these custom tools, we observed the usage of standard administration utilities. For instance,\n\nanother tool often uploaded by the attackers to the victim's machine is \"winrs.exe\":\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is an UPX packed binary, which contains the genuine \"dnsquery.exe\" tool from Microsoft, unpacked\n\nMD5: c0c03b71684eb0545ef9182f5f9928ca.\n\nIn several cases, an interesting update has been observed -- a malware from a different, yet related family.\n\n**Size: 275,968 bytes**\n**MD5: e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f**\n**Compiled: Thu Nov 08 11:05:35 2012**\n\nanother example:\n\n**Size: 218,112 bytes**\n**MD5: 071d3b60ebec2095165b6879e41211f2**\n**Compiled: Thu Nov 08 11:04:39 2012**\n\nThis backdoor is more sophisticated and belongs to the next level of cyber-espionage tools called the\n\n\"Carbon system\" or Cobra by the Turla attackers. Several plugins for the \"Carbon system\" are known to\n\nexist.\n\n_Decoded configuration for e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f_\n\nNote: the command and control servers www.losguayaberos[.]com and\n\n**thebesttothbrushes[.]com have been sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab.**\n\nOther packages delivered to the victims include:\n\n**MD5: c7617251d523f3bc4189d53df1985ca9**\n**MD5: 0f76ef2e6572befdc2ca1ca2ab15e5a1**\n\nThese top level packages deploy both updated Epic backdoors and Turla Carbon system backdoors to\n\nconfirmed victims, effectively linking the Epic and Turla Carbon operations together.\n\nThe Turla Carbon dropper from these packages has the following properties:\n\n**MD5: cb1b68d9971c2353c2d6a8119c49b51f**\n\n\n-----\n\nthe debug path inside:\n\nThis acts as a dropper for the following modules, both 32 and 64 bit:\n\n**MD5** **Resource number**\n4c1017de62ea4788c7c8058a8f825a2d 101\n43e896ede6fe025ee90f7f27c6d376a4 102\ne6d1dcc6c2601e592f2b03f35b06fa8f 104\n554450c1ecb925693fedbb9e56702646 105\ndf230db9bddf200b24d8744ad84d80e8 161\n91a5594343b47462ebd6266a9c40abbe 162\n244505129d96be57134cb00f27d4359c 164\n4ae7e6011b550372d2a73ab3b4d67096 165\n\nThe Carbon system is in essence an extensible platform, very similar to other attack platforms such as the\n\n[Tilded platform or the Flame platform. The plugins for the Carbon system can be easily recognized as they](http://securelist.com/analysis/publications/36462/stuxnetduqu-the-evolution-of-drivers/)\n\nalways feature at least two exports named:\n\nModuleStart\n\nModuleStop\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral Epic backdoors appear to have been designed to work as Carbon system plugins as well - they\n\nrequire a specialized loader to start in victim systems that do not have the Carbon system deployed.\n\nSome modules have artifacts which indicate the Carbon system is already at version 3.x, although the\n\nexact Carbon system version is very rarely seen in samples:\n\nThe author of the Carbon module above can be also seen in the code, as \"gilg\", which also authored several\n\nother Turla modules.\n\nWe are planning to cover the Turla Carbon system with more details in a future report.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Language artifacts\n\nThe payload recovered from one of the mothership servers (at\n\n**newsforum.servehttp[.]com/wordpress/wp-includes/css/img/upload.php, MD5:**\n\n**4dc22c1695d1f275c3b6e503a1b171f5, Compiled: Thu Sep 06 14:09:55 2012) contains two modules, a**\n\nloader/injector and a backdoor. Internally, the backdoor is named \"Zagruzchick.dll\":\n\n\n-----\n\nThe word \"Zagruzchick\" means \"boot loader\" in Russian.\n\nThe Control panel for the Epic motherships also sets the language to codepage \"1251\":\n\nCodepage 1251 is commonly used to render Cyrillic characters.\n\nThere are other indications that the attackers are not native English language speakers:\n\n_Password it´s wrong!_\n\n_Count successful more MAX_\n\n_File is not exists_\n\n_File is exists for edit_\n\nThe sample e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f that was delivered to several Epic victims as an\n\nupgraded backdoor, has the compilation code page language set to \"LANG_RUSSIAN\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor behind the \"Epic\" operation uses mainly hacked servers to host their proxies. The hacked\n\nservers are controlled through the use of a PHP webshell. This shell is password protected; the password is\n\nchecked against an MD5 hash:\n\nThe MD5 \"af3e8be26c63c4dd066935629cf9bac8\" has been solved by Kaspersky Lab as the\n\n[password \"kenpachi\". In February 2014 we observed the Miniduke threat actor using the same backdoor](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/31112/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/)\n\non their hacked servers, although using a much stronger password.\n\nOnce again, it is also interesting to point out the usage of Codepage 1251 in the webshell, which is used to\n\nrender Cyrillic characters.\n\nThere appears to be several links between Turla and Miniduke, but we will leave that for a future blogpost.\n\n## Victim statistics\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich were saved for debugging purposes by the attackers.\n\nThis is the country distribution for the top 20 affected countries by victim's IP:\n\nAccording to the public information available for the victims' IPs, targets of \"Epic\" belong to the following\n\ncategories:\n\nGovernment\n\nMinistry of interior (EU country)\n\nMinistry of trade and commerce (EU country)\n\nMinistry of foreign/external affairs (Asian country EU country)\n\n\n-----\n\nEmbassies\n\nMilitary (EU country)\n\nEducation\n\nResearch (Middle East)\n\nPharmaceutical companies\n\nUnknown (impossible to determine based on IP/existing data)\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen G-Data published their Turla paper, there were few details publicly available on how victims get\n\ninfected with this malware campaign. Our analysis indicates this is a sophisticated multi-stage infection;\n\nwhich begins with Epic Turla. This is used to gain a foothold and validate the high profile victim. If the\n\nvictim is interesting, they get upgraded to the Turla Carbon system.\n\nMost recently, we observed this attack against a Kaspersky Lab user on August 5, 2014, indicating the\n\noperation remains fresh and ongoing.\n\n**_Note: A full analysis of the Epic attacks is available to the Kaspersky Intelligent Services_**\n\n**_[customers.
