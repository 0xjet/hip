Some denounce these names\nas nothing but marketing fluff, others as the bane of their existence. But they play a\nvery important role misunderstood by many and misused by more. This is the story of\nactivity groups: what they are, how they’re made, and how they should be used.\n\nActivity groups are not created by some evil marketing genius, but instead part of the\nnatural analysis process using a trait in human cognition to group like-elements\ntogether allowing us to identify patterns, provide perspective, and make better\ndecisions over many individual elements. Analysts across almost every field of study\nuse this technique – that of grouping, classification, and correlation.\n\nIntrusion analysts create activity groups: separate-but-somehow-related elements of\ncomputer and network intrusions clustered together to solve some analytic problem.\nThe concept is not novel but was first defined in the Diamond Model of Intrusion\nAnalysis. Analysts give these groups labels for the purpose of easy communication.\n\n**Creating and Managing Activity Groups**\n\n\n-----\n\nanalytic problem and the necessary data and relations to address the problem. Just as\nany scientist must first generate hypotheses, experimental frameworks, and gathering\nthe necessary data, the intrusion analyst must first ask “what am I trying to\naccomplish?”\n\nFrom this problem analysts create a “grouping function” (usually this is done mentally)\nto identify the features to compare (such as same IP/Domain, same file hash) and the\nconfidence necessary (e.g., are two IPs in the same class C subnet going to be related\nin the group?). The analyst then groups all of the related events and follows by finally\nasking the question and coming to a conclusion – or going back for more data.\n\nActivity groups are not static! In fact, over time and as the number of elements grows,\nthe confidence that the group still accurately addresses the question declines. So,\nactivity groups should change over time – be redefined and “retired” when no longer\nneeded, have ceased to deliver new data, or outlive their usefulness. Unfortunately,\nwe see many groups live well beyond their time and scope harming our ability as a\ncommunity to generate meaningful conclusions.\n\n**Using Activity Groups**\n\nDefenders should look to activity groups in order to help derive effective and efficient\nmitigation strategies. They should group threat behaviors to identify the fewest\nmitigation actions necessary to achieve protection against the largest number of\ngroups (e.g., the top 10 security controls). Defenders should extract intelligence from\nactivity groups to inform red-teams, blue-teams, and the purple-teams in-between.\n\nOne of the most commonly seen analytic problems to use activity groups publicly is to\nidentify a set of infrastructure and capabilities most likely used by the same set of\noperators. This grouping then commonly extends into attribution – the “whodunit” of\nthreat intelligence questions. But there are many questions addressed by activity\ngroups, including:\n\nAttribution: which activity is caused by the same set of organizations or\noperators?\nMalware authorship: which malware could potentially be authored by the same\ndeveloper?\nTrending: How have events changed over time?\nCross-capability: Which disparate activities show usage of common capabilities?\nCenter of gravity: Which processes are common across the largest set of activity\ngroups?\n\nMany people identify activity groups only with attribution thinking the name of a group\nis nothing by a synonym for the group, organization, or individuals behind the activity.\nThis is a mistake. There is no one way to define an activity group. For instance, Dragos\ncorrelates activity into groups based on similar behavior for the purposes of deriving\nmore effective defensive strategies. If the activity in the group happens to be the\nresponsibility of multiple organizations, countries, individuals, etc. this has no bearing\n\n\n-----\n\nMany analysts associate like-activity-groups together based on commonalities such as\nshared infrastructure, capabilities, or similar behaviors. Many analysts arrange the\nnames and their associations or equivalencies from different companies,\ngovernments, and sources in a spreadsheet commonly referred to as “Rosetta\nStones.” However, equating two or more disparate analytically-derived groups is a\nmistake because this method effectively makes a group out of groups without\nconcerning whether the individual groups were created using the same fundamental\nprinciples, bias mitigation, practices, or to answer the same analytic questions. If they\nwere not, then the new “group of groups” will be fundamentally incorrect.\n\nTherefore, it is with warning and hesitation that analysts should proceed with any\ncross-naming correlation if not done by the original analysts involved.\n\n**Questions and Answers**\n\nHere are selected questions received during our webinar on the topic and my answer.\n\nQ: Do you know if any entity or source that happens to be correlating activity groups\nacross vendors that can be used as a point of reference?\n\nA: There are some that exist but I do not recommend the practice as it lacks the\nnecessary protections against the problems with the practice as outlined above.\n\nQ: How do you plan on working with other security companies on standardizing the\nnaming conventions for the AG, or do you plan on keeping this internal to Dragos?\n\nA: I have, for good or ill, been responsible for almost a dozen naming schemes. I have\nalso been involved in several “cross-naming cooperative schemes” – these went poorly\nand ended up failures. Therefore, at Dragos we use rare earth mineral names and\npoint out associations with the activity described by others but won’t standardize with\nother companies at this time.\n\nQ: What are you most excited about in the coming 2 years?\n\nA: The fact that defenders are getting strong more quickly than adversaries. Things\nstill won’t be easier but we’re seeing a rise in defense as never before. I’m excited to\nsee that come to fruition.\n\nQ: Can you compare the diamond model to the MITRE ATT&CK tool, aside from the\nfact that ATT&CK if for the IT side of the house? They are working on something ICSspecific. How do they differ? Can they be used in conjunction?\n\nA: Just like the Kill Chain, all three (Diamond Model, ATT&CK, and Kill Chain) are\ncomplementary. They each try to accomplish different things. The Diamond Model is\na model of intrusion analysis. The Kill Chain proposes a phase-based approach to\ndetection and mitigation. ATT&CK defines a taxonomy for cyber threat behaviors and\nprocesses. They can all be used together!\n\n\n-----\n\ngroups to ones that may be the same actors or interest?\n\nA: This can be done and is a valid method of conducting activity grouping. However,\nfew analysts have access to the data necessary for grouping threats by same actor or\ninterest (namely: national intelligence organizations). For the rest of us, all attempts to\ngroup by same actor or interest is usually a “grasping at straws” exercise based on\ninference rather than direct evidence. Example: if I state the interests of a group are\nconclusively set on a few industries, I may be making that conclusion based on little\ndata when in fact the whole set of data points to a very different interest – a fallacy in\narguing the general from the specific, or selection bias.\n\nThis blog post is a companion to the webinar: Uncovering Threat Activity Groups for\nIntelligence-Driven Defense.\n\n**[Threat Activity Groups – Dragos from](https://www.slideshare.net/DragosInc/threat-activity-groups-dragos)** **[Dragos, Inc.](https://www.slideshare.net/DragosInc)**\n\n\n-----",
