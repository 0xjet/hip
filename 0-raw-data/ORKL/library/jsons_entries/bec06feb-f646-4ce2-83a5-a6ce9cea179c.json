Files shared on this](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.lockbit)\nsite include business documents, internal projects, and various aerospace and defense industry standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nkopter ransom page.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n\n-----\n\nkopter sample files.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nIn an email, the operators of the LockBit ransomware told ZDNet that they breached Kopter's network last week by exploiting a VPN appliance\nthat used a weak password and did not have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.\n\nThe LockBit gang also said they operate a web portal on the dark web where they show details to hacked companies about the attack,\nincluding a ransom demand. LockBit operators said someone from Kopter accessed the ransom page, but the company did not engage with\nthem in a chat window provided to hacked companies.\n\nKopter has not publicly disclosed a security breach on its website or via business wires.\n\nA Kopter spokesperson did not return an email seeking comment on the ransomware attack. Phone calls made on Friday also remained\nunanswered.\n\nThe Switzerland-based company was founded in 2007 and is known for its line of small and medium-class civilian helicopters.\n\n[In January 2020 Italian aerospace and defense company Leonardo acquired Kopter for an undisclosed sum](https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/press-release-detail/-/detail/28-01-2020-leonardo-to-acquire-kopter-with-the-aim-of-extending-its-helicopter-market-leadership)\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** **,** **p**\n\n\n-----",
