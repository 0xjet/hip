    "plain_text": "After taking a look at recent Korplug (PlugX) detections, we identified two larger scale campaigns\n\nemploying this well-known Remote Access Trojan. This blog gives an overview of the first one, related to\n\nAfghanistan & Tajikistan. The other campaign, where the targets were a number of high-profile\n\norganizations in Russia, will be the subject of Anton Cherepanov’s presentation at the ZeroNights\n\n**security conference in Moscow this week.**\n\nSometimes malware used in various attacks is unique enough to identify related incidents, which makes\n\n[tracking individual botnets simpler. An example is the BlackEnergy Lite variant (also known as](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/22/back-in-blackenergy-2014/)\n\nBlackEnergy 3) used by a group of attackers (that was then given the name Quedagh, or Sandworm)\n\nagainst targets in Ukraine and other countries. BlackEnergy Lite is clearly distinguishable from the\n\nnumerous binaries of the more common BlackEnergy 2 also circulating in-the-wild.\n\nIn other cases, attackers use more common tools for accomplishing their criminal goals. For example, the\n\nKorplug RAT (a.k.a .PlugX) is a well-known toolkit associated with Chinese APT groups and used in a\n\nlarge number of targeted attacks since 2012. For the past several weeks we have taken a closer look at a\n\ngreat number of detections of this malware in many unrelated incidents.\n\nAmong these, we were able to discover several successful infections where the employed Korplug samples\n\n\n-----\n\nDOMAIN: www.notebookhk.net\n\nUpdated Date: 2013-11-12 18:03:45\n\nCreate Date: 2013-06-18 11:08:17\n\nRegistrant Name: lee stan\n\nRegistrant Organization: lee stan\n\nRegistrant Street: xianggangdiqu\n\nRegistrant City: xianggangdiqu\n\nRegistrant State: xianggang\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 796373\n\nRegistrant Country: HK\n\nRegistrant Phone : +0.04375094543\n\nRegistrant Fax: +0.04375094543\n\nRegistrant Email:stanlee@gmail.com\n\nOther Korplug samples were connecting to a different domain name resolving to the same IPs as\n\nnotebookhk.net:\n\nDOMAIN: www.dicemention.com\n\nUpdated Date: 2013-11-12 18:05:33\n\nCreate Date: 2013-09-10 14:35:11\n\nRegistrant Name: z x\n\nRegistrant Organization: z x\n\nRegistrant Street: xianggangdiqu\n\nRegistrant City: xianggangdiqu\n\nRegistrant State: xianggang\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 123456\n\nRegistrant Country: HK\n\nRegistrant Phone : +0.0126324313\n\nRegistrant Fax: +0.0126324313\n\nRegistrant Email: 123@123.com\n\nDOMAIN: www.abudlrasul.com\n\nUpdated Date: 2014-10-16 14:16:27\n\nCreate Date: 2014-10-16 14:16:27\n\nRegistrant Name: gang xin\n\nRegistrant Organization: gang xin\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistrant City: Argentina\n\nRegistrant State: Argentina\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 647902\n\nRegistrant Country: AR\n\nRegistrant Phone : +54.0899567089\n\nRegistrant Fax: +54.0899567089\n\nRegistrant Email: woffg89@yahoo.com\n\nTaking these C&Cs as a starting point, we were able to locate a number of victims infected through various\n\nexploit-laden spear-phishing documents and cunningly-named archives.\n\nA table with a selection of RTF documents and RAR self-extracting archives with a .SCR extension is\n\nshown below:\n\n|File name|English translation|SHA1|\n|---|---|---|\n|Situation Report about Afghan.doc||36119221826D0290BC23371B55A8C0E6A84718DD|\n|AGREEMENT BETWEENTHE NATO AND AFGHANISTAN ON THE STATUS OF NATO FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN.doc||A6642BC9F3425F0AB93D462002456BE231BB5646|\n|news.doc||51CDC273B5638E06906BCB700335E288807744B5|\n|План деятельности соединений и воинских частей Приволжского региона на июль 2014 г.scr|Activity plan for military units in the Volga region in July 2014|EA6EE9EAB546FB9F93B75DCB650AF22A95486391|\n|телефонный справочник структуры МИД КР .scr|Telephone directory of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic|D297DC7D29E42E8D37C951B0B11629051EEBE9C0|\n|О Центре социальной адаптации военнослужащих.scr|About the Center for social adaptation of servicemen|8E5E19EBE719EBF7F8BE4290931FFA173E658CB8|\n|Протокол встречи НГШ КНР.scr|Meeting minutes of the General Staff of the PRC|1F726E94B90034E7ABD148FE31EBA08774D1506F|\n|исправленный шаблон плана мероприятий.scr|Corrected action plan template|A9C627AA09B8CC50A83FF2728A3978492AEB79D8|\n|Situation Report about Afghan.scr||A9C627AA09B8CC50A83FF2728A3978492AEB79D8|\n\n\nВоенно-политическая\n\nб ИРА\n\n\nMilitary and political\nsituation in Islamic\nR bli f E 8 C 6F EA DFD E C 8 D 6 D8 B F\n\n\n-----\n\nAfghan Air Force.scr E32081C56F39EA14DFD1E449C28219D264D80B2F\n\nплан мероприятий.scr Action plan 1F726E94B90034E7ABD148FE31EBA08774D1506F\n\nSome of the above-mentioned files also contained decoy documents:\n\nIn all of the cases, three binary files were dropped (apart from decoy documents) that led to the Korplug\n\ntrojan being loading into memory.\n\nexe – a legitimate executable with a Kaspersky digital signature that would load a DLL with a\n\nspecific file name\n\n|план мероприятий.scr|Action plan|1F726E94B90034E7ABD148FE31EBA08774D1506F|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\ndll.avp raw Korplug binary\n\nThe Korplug RAT is known to use this side-loading trick by abusing legitimate digitally signed executables\n\nand is a way to stay under the radar, since a trusted application with a valid signature among startup items\n\nis less likely to raise suspicion.\n\nThe maliciously crafted documents are RTF files that successfully exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability\n\nin Microsoft Word. The image below shows the beginning of the CVE-2012-0158 shellcode in ASCII\n\nencoding within the document (the opcodes 60, 55, 8bec disassemble to pusha; push ebp; mov ebp, esp).\n\nInterestingly, though, the documents also contain the newer CVE-2014-1761 exploit that was extensively\n\n[used in targeted attacks carried out by a number other malware families this year (including BlackEnergy,](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/22/back-in-blackenergy-2014/)\n\n[Sednit, MiniDuke, and others). However, this exploit is not implemented correctly due to a wrong file](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/08/sednit-espionage-group-now-using-custom-exploit-kit/)\n\noffset in the 1[st] stage shellcode.\n\nBelow we see the disassembly of the 1[st] stage shellcode where it checks the presence of the tag “p!11”\n\nmarking the beginning of the 2[nd] stage shellcode and loads it into memory. Even though the tag and 2[nd]\n\nstage shellcode is present in the RTF, it’s at a different offset, and thus never is loaded.\n\n[Sophos’ Gabor Szappanos gives a possible explanation how these malformed samples may have come into](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical%20papers/sophos-rotten-tomato-campaign.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nESET LiveGrid telemetry indicates that the attacks against these targets have been going on since at least\n\nJune 2014 and continue through today.\n\nWe were able to pinpoint the targets to residents of the following countries:\n\nAfghanistan\n\nTajikistan\n\nRussia\n\nKyrgyzstan\n\nKazakhstan\n\nFrom the topics of the files used to spread the malware, as well as from the affected targets, it appears that\n\nthe attackers are interested in gathering intelligence related to Afghan, Tajik and Russian military and\n\ndiplomatic subjects.\n\nInterestingly, most of the affected victims have another thing in common – a number of other RATs, file\n\nstealing trojans or keyloggers were detected on their systems on top of the Korplug RAT detection. One of\n\nthese ‘alternative RATs’ was connecting to a domain also used by the Korplug samples.\n\nSince the functionality of these tools was partly overlapping with that of Korplug, it left us wondering\n\nwhether the attackers were just experimenting with different RATs or were they supplementing some\n\nfunctionality that they were unable to accomplish.\n\nAdditional information about two malware families that were most often found accompanying Korplug\n\ninfections is given below.\n\n### Alternative Malware #1: DarkStRat\n\nA curious Remote Access Trojan, as research points to a Chinese connection but the commands it listens\n\nto are in Spanish (translation in English):\n\nCERRAR (close)\n\nDESINSTALAR (uninstall)\n\nSERVIDOR (server)\n\nINFO\n\nMAININFO\n\nPING\n\nREBOOT\n\n\n-----\n\nPROC\n\nKILLPROC\n\nVERUNIDADES (see units)\n\nLISTARARCHIVOS (list files)\n\nEXEC\n\nDELFILE\n\nDELFOLDER\n\nRENAME\n\nMKDIR\n\nCAMBIOID (change ID)\n\nGETFILE/SENDFILE/RESUMETRANSFER\n\nSHELL\n\nSERVICIOSLISTAR (list service)\n\nINICIARSERVICIO (start service)\n\nDETENERSERVICIO (stop service)\n\nBORRARSERVICIO (erase service)\n\nINSTALARSERVICIO (install service)\n\nThe malware can manage processes and services on the infected machine, transfer files to and from the\n\nC&C server, run shell commands, and so on. It is written in Delphi and connects to\n\nwww.dicemention.com. Some samples contain a digital signature by “Nanning weiwu Technology co.,ltd”.\n\n### Alternative Malware #2: File Stealer\n\nThis malware, written in C, and contains several functions for harvesting files off the victim’s hard drive\n\naccording to criteria set in the configuration file. Apart from doing a recursive sweep of all logical fixed\n\nand remote drives, it also continually monitors any attached removable media or network shares by\n\n[listening to DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL events.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363205%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n\nIn addition to collecting files, the malware attempts to gather saved passwords, history of visited URLs,\n\naccount information and proxy information from the following applications:\n\nMicrosoft Messenger\n\nMicrosoft Outlook\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer\n\nMozilla Firefox\n\nThe C&C domains used by this malware are:\n\n\n-----\n\nworksware.net\n\nSome samples of this file stealer detected in these campaigns also contain the signature by “Nanning\n\nweiwu Technology co.,ltd” – another indicator that the infections are related.\n\n## List of SHA1 hashes:\n\nKorplug:\n\n5DFA79EB89B3A8DDBC55252BD330D04D285F9189\n\n095550E3F0E5D24A59ADD9390E6E17120039355E\n\n5D760403108BDCDCE5C22403387E89EDC2694860\n\n05BFE122F207DF7806EB5E4CE69D3AEC26D74190\n\n548577598A670FFD7770F01B8C8EEFF853C222C7\n\n530D26A9BEEDCCED0C36C54C1BF3CDA28D2B6E62\n\nF6CB6DB20AA8F17769095042790AEB60EECD58B0\n\nEF17B7EC3111949CBDBDEB5E0E15BD2C6E90358F\n\n17CA3BBDDEF164E6493F32C952002E34C55A74F2\n\n973EA910EA3734E45FDE304F20AB6CF067456551\n\n47D78FBFB2EFC3AB9DDC653A0F03D560D972BF67\n\n0B5A7E49987EF2C320864CF205B7048F7032300D\n\nE81E0F416752B336396294D24E639AE86D9C6BAA\n\nE930D3A2E6B2FFDC7052D7E18F51BD5A765BDB90\n\nAlternative Malware #1:\n\nFDD41EB3CBB631F38AC415347E25926E3E3F09B6\n\n457F4FFA2FE1CACFEA53F8F5FF72C3FA61939CCD\n\n5B6D654EB16FC84A212ACF7D5A05A8E8A642CE20\n\n7D59B19BD56E1D2C742C39A2ABA9AC34F6BC58D4\n\nD7D130B8CC9BEA51143F28820F08068521763494\n\n01B4B92D5839ECF3130F5C69652295FE4F2DA0C5\n\n02C38EC1C67098E1F6854D1125D3AED6268540DE\n\nAlternative Malware #2:\n\n3A7FB6E819EEC52111693219E604239BD25629E9\n\nBF77D0BA7F3E60B45BD0801979B12BEA703B227B\n\n\n-----\n\nA29F64CD7B78E51D0C9FDFBDCBC57CED43A157B2\n\n34754E8B410C9480E1ADFB31A4AA72419056B622\n\n17A2F18C9CCAAA714FD31BE2DE0BC62B2C310D8F\n\n6D99ACEA8323B8797560F7284607DB08ECA616D8\n\n1884A05409C7EF877E0E1AAAEC6BB9D59E065D7C\n\n1FC6FB0D35DCD0517C82ADAEF1A85FFE2AFAB4EE\n\n5860C99E5065A414C91F51B9E8B779D10F40ADC4\n\n7950D5B57FA651CA6FA9180E39B6E8CC1E65B746\n\n**Research by: Anton Cherepanov**\n\n[Author Robert Lipovsky, ESET](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113721996266516866756/posts)\n\n\n-----",
