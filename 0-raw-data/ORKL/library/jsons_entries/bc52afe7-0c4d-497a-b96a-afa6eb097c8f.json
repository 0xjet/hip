Moving from a traditional corporate IT stack to a\nglobal “work from anywhere” workforce in a few short weeks was truly a remarkable\nundertaking for many organizations, and the adversaries took notice. Attackers —\nboth eCrime and state-sponsored — continued to quickly adapt to broad industry\nchanges in an effort to leapfrog legacy defenses, deploy new ransomware and\nexecute data extortion attacks. They persisted in exploiting the path of least\nresistance, facilitated by the increased attack surface created by the remote\nworkforce, preying on victims’ emotions and corporate vulnerabilities.\n\nWe learned the basic cybersecurity principles we’ve always advocated remain critical:\nasset inventory, vulnerability management, multifactor authentication, network\nsegmentation, system backup and recovery, and more. Our Services mission has\nalways been focused on helping organizations train for, react to and remediate a\nbreach quickly and effectively to allow them to get back to business faster. In light of\nthe events of 2020, we have organized our responders into “Front-Line Teams” that\nhave a stronger and more defined focus on each of these essential areas:\n\n**\u0007Incident Response (IR): Rapid response, containment and investigation with**\ndigital forensics and root cause analysis\n\n**\u0007Endpoint Recovery Services: Containment of active threats, recovery and**\nremediation with speed and surgical precision\n\n**\u0007Falcon Complete™: Continuous 24/7/365 managed detection, response and**\nremediation, backed by up to $1M Breach Prevention Warranty\n\nThis report outlines trends we’ve identified in the data we collect from hundreds\nof engagements, along with key themes we’ve observed, to enable you to better\nprotect your organization. I encourage you to review it from your perspective — in\na similar situation, what would you, your teams and your organizational leadership\ndo? Perhaps more importantly, how would you fare? Identifying your vulnerabilities,\nbecoming more aware and educating yourself is half the battle.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe know attackers will continue to refine their techniques and strengthen their skills\nto evade security, monetize their access and/or reach their ultimate objective. The\nyear 2020 saw more intrusions than ever before, larger ransomware demands and\nlittle opportunity for organizations to improve their security posture while keeping\npace with the chaos brought on by the global pandemic. Corporate defenders are\nspread thin, and adversaries are well organized and better funded than ever, making\nit much more difficult to detect and respond to threats.\n\nAll is not lost though. CrowdStrike is steadfastly helping our customers move from\nsimply reacting to breaches days or weeks after the fact to continuous monitoring,\ndetection, response and optimization. We are glad you trust us to provide you with\nthe support you need to safeguard your critical assets, especially in these uncertain\ntimes. We appreciate your confidence and thank you for your partnership.\n\nOne team, one fight.\n\n## Shawn Henry\n\n**Shawn Henry**\n\nCrowdStrike, President of Services and Chief Security Officer\n\n\n-----\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines Report brings together the insights and\nobservations of dedicated CrowdStrike team members from all corners of the globe,\nwho work tirelessly to help organizations defend against and recover from intrusions\nevery day. Not only does the report provide a clear picture of how adversaries are\nadapting to today’s realities, it also includes concrete recommendations that you can\nimplement in your organization today to improve your cybersecurity readiness.\n\nThe findings and trends in this report are derived from data points and insights collected\nfrom a wide variety of incident response (IR) engagements and proactive services\nactivities over the past 12 months. Key findings from these metrics include:\n\n**\u0007The volume and velocity of financially motivated attacks are staggering.**\nFinancially motivated attacks represented 63% of CrowdStrike Services cases\nover the past year, with 81% of financially motivated attacks involving the\ndeployment of ransomware or a precursor to ransomware activities.\n\n**\u0007Buying technology alone is not enough — configuration, coverage and**\n**management matters. In at least 30% of incident response engagements,**\nCrowdStrike observed the organization’s antivirus solutions were either\nincorrectly configured with weak prevention settings or not fully deployed\nacross the environment, which may have been a factor in the threat actor\ngaining and maintaining access.\n\n**\u0007Intrusions should not be thought of as a one-time event. The Services team**\nlooked at organizations that experienced an intrusion and then leveraged\nCrowdStrike to manage their endpoint protection and remediation efforts\nmoving forward. CrowdStrike identified that 68% of those organizations\nexperienced another intrusion attempt, which was prevented.\n\n**\u0007Shifting to continuous monitoring and response changes the game.**\nRather than thinking of intrusion response as a one-off emergency activity,\nmature organizations plan for real-time, continuous monitoring and response.\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon Complete managed service offering reduced the average\ntime to detect, investigate and remediate from a total of 162 hours — nearly\nseven days — to less than one hour for customers.\n\n**\u0007Outside counsel is playing a bigger role in the incident response process.**\nOutside counsel retained CrowdStrike to advise its clients in 49% of the\nincidents investigated in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The volume and velocity of financially motivated attacks are staggering.\n\n\nIn addition to these findings, CrowdStrike’s incident responders identified a number of\nkey themes in 2020. Organizations should be mindful of the following:\n\n**\u0007Widespread remote work has broad-reaching effects on cybersecurity.**\nNetworks around the world were turned inside out as office workers became\nremote workers, with dramatic effects on how attackers target organizations\nand how defenders must react.\n\n**\u0007Ransomware actors have learned new tricks. Not content with just encrypting**\ndata for extortion, eCrime actors are increasingly destroying and/or threatening\nto leak data, as they target ever-larger ransom payments.\n\n**\u0007Cloud infrastructure requires special attention from defenders. The global**\npandemic accelerated digital transformation — including cloud adoption —\nfor many organizations, and attackers took advantage of this attack surface.\nDefending the cloud requires additional planning and focus beyond traditional\non-premises networks.\n\n**\u0007Weaknesses in public-facing applications and services are increasingly**\n**dangerous. CrowdStrike observed significant increases in attackers targeting**\npublic-facing applications and services in 2020. Defenders must continue to\nbe vigilant to ensure no exterior gaps exist for an adversary to use as an initial\nfoothold.\n\n**\u0007State-sponsored adversaries leave smaller footprints. While eCrime**\nactors got most of the headlines in 2020, state-sponsored adversaries\nremained active across a wide range of sectors. Detecting and stopping these\nsophisticated intrusions requires a well-coordinated and holistic response.\n\n**\u0007Organizations focused on driving key security enhancements can stop the**\n**next breach. An intrusion can happen to any organization — how you respond**\nand learn from prior incidents can make a significant difference on the impact\nof the next breach.\n\nOrganizations that heed the observations and recommendations in this report will see\nsignificant improvements in their ability to defend against many of the common types of\nattacks. CrowdStrike is here to help, providing highly skilled cybersecurity professionals\nwho partner with clients, ensuring that the adversaries are defeated and any damage is\nquickly remediated.\n\n\n-----\n\n## A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE\n\n##### CROWDSTRIKE’S POWERFUL REPORTS ARE ENABLED BY POWERFUL INSIGHTS\n\n**Falcon OverWatch Threat**\n**Hunting Report**\nInsights gained from proactive\nthreat hunting conducted in\ncustomer environments where the\nCrowdStrike Falcon platform is\ndeployed\n\n\n**CrowdStrike**\n**Global Threat Report**\nGlobal cyber threat\nintelligence and insights\n\n\n**CrowdStrike Services**\n**Cyber Front Lines Report**\nInsights from incident response engagements\ninvolving CrowdStrike Services\n\nCrowdStrike provides a unique perspective when assessing the state of cyber threats,\ngiven the company’s industry-leading expertise in threat intelligence, managed\nservices and professional services, combined with the power of the massive, cloudnative CrowdStrike Falcon® platform for endpoint and cloud protection. These distinct\nareas of expertise are represented in three annual publications, each highlighting the\ncontributions and assessments of individual CrowdStrike teams:\n\n**[\u0007CrowdStrike Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)**\n\n[\u0007Falcon OverWatch Threat Hunting Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report-2020/)\n\n\u0007CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines Report\n\nThe CrowdStrike Global Threat Report combines CrowdStrike’s comprehensive\nglobal observations with real-world case studies to deliver deep insights on\nmodern adversaries and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The\nFalcon OverWatch Threat Hunting Report presents observations from the Falcon\nOverWatch™ team as they hunt adversaries. This CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front\nLines Report documents the real-world experience gained from the Services team as\nthey respond to incidents and breaches. With such a comprehensive and holistic view\nof the threat landscape, CrowdStrike can provide specific guidance on the actions\norganizations can take to improve their security posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n## KEY FINDINGS: DEMOGRAPHICS AND METRICS\n\nIn keeping with the format of last year’s CrowdStrike Services Cyber Front Lines\nReport, this year’s edition reflects data derived from CrowdStrike Services incident\nresponse, managed services and proactive services engagements over 2020. The\nreal-world observations and analysis presented in this report should prove both\ncompelling and practical, as well as the recommendations you can implement within\nyour organization to improve your cybersecurity readiness. The organizations\nassisted by CrowdStrike during 2020 spanned 15 industry sectors, resided in 34\ncountries, and varied in size from large global organizations to regionally focused\nsmall/mid-sized businesses (SMBs). Of note, CrowdStrike served 25% of the\nFortune 100 and 9% of the Global 100 organizations in 2020.\n\nFigure 1 depicts the breakdown of organizations by industry within the dataset\nleveraged for this report.\n\n###### 10.9% Healthcare  Finance 10.6%\n\nRetail 9.4%\n\n###### 15.5% Information Technology\n\nGovernment 8.5%\n\n###### 17.3% Manufacturing\n\n 1.2% Telecom \n\nEntertainment 5.8%\n\n###### 2.1% Legal\n\n 2.4% Defense  Professional Services 5.2%\n\n 2.4% Agriculture  Energy 3.0%\n\n 2.7% Insurance  Travel 2.7%\n\n**Figure 1.

While adversary motives vary, in\n2020 financially motivated eCrime attacks far outnumber any others by volume —\nrepresenting 63% of CrowdStrike’s incident response engagements. eCrime adversaries\noperate in both targeted and opportunistic ways, leaving no organization — regardless\nof structure, size, industry or location — immune from attacks.\n\nAs with reports in years past, this report offers statistics and anecdotes that provide\nunique visibility into the adversaries and trends the CrowdStrike Services team is\nseeing from the front lines of working with organizations. Based on the numbers\nderived from Services engagements, the following trends have been observed.\n\n###### THE VOLUME AND VELOCITY OF FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED ATTACKS ARE STAGGERING\n\nSixty-three percent of incidents investigated in 2020 involved financially motivated\nthreat actors. These attacks ranged from ransomware targeting organizations of all\nshapes and sizes, to unauthorized financial transactions in regionally focused SMBs,\nall the way to large global enterprises. Among the financially motivated eCrime\nattacks, 81% involved ransomware. The other 19% included eCrime attacks such as\npoint-of-sale intrusions, ecommerce website attacks, business email compromise\nand cryptocurrency mining.\n\n###### Other eCrime\n\n##### 19.0%\n\n###### Ransomware\n\n##### 81.0%\n\n**Figure 2. Ransomware involved in financially motivated eCrime attacks in 2020**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THREAT ACTORS ARE UPPING THEIR GAME WITH MALWARE THAT EVADES TRADITIONAL ANTIVIRUS\n\nAs ransoms often continue to exceed seven figures and eCrime generally becomes\nmore lucrative, threat actors have additional capital and continue to mature their\norganization to raise their game. What used to be smaller-scale business operations\nhave become big businesses generating exponential growth in revenue. With this,\nthreat actors are investing more into the development and deployment of techniques\nthat evade antivirus countermeasures. Antivirus solutions failed to provide protection\nin 40% of the incidents CrowdStrike responded to in 2020 in which either malware\nwas undetected or a portion of the attack sequence was missed by antivirus tools.\nAnd in 30% of incidents, antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR)\ntools were not fully deployed, were improperly configured or were not supported\non the operating system. This data highlights why it is important to protect your\norganization with next-generation antivirus solutions that leverage the cloud for\nscalability and use modern techniques including machine learning and behavioral\ndetection to identify advanced threats. It also emphasizes the need to not just buy\na security product, but actually invest in ensuring comprehensive coverage in your\nenvironment and proper configuration, tuning and integrating it into your security\noperations program to mitigate even the most sophisticated attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### AT A GLANCE\n\nHere are a few additional data points that reveal insights into the more successful\nattack techniques, as well as some benchmarks for defenders.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Malware Only|Malware-Free|Both|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n### 68%\n###### OF ORGANIZATIONS STUDIED POST-IR ENCOUNTERED ANOTHER SOPHISTICATED INTRUSION ATTEMPT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS\n\n\n###### INTRUSIONS SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS A ONE-TIME EVENT\n\nOrganizations that engage a professional services firm for incident response are\noften eager to get the experience behind them and move on with business as usual.\nCompletion of an incident response, however, represents a critical opportunity to\ndrive improvements in people, process, technology and cybersecurity maturity that\nshould not be overlooked. Ignoring this opportunity to mature leaves organizations\nexposed to the next intrusion, which is rarely far down the road.\n\nCrowdStrike examined data from organizations that engaged incident response\nservices and later opted to engage CrowdStrike for fully managed endpoint protection\nthrough the Falcon Complete service. Of these organizations, 68% encountered and\nstopped another sophisticated intrusion attempt within the next 12 months.\n\nIt is tempting to think of intrusions as a lightning strike — a blinding flash that is\nunlikely to strike the same place twice. Unfortunately, intrusion attempts are rarely\na one-time event. Organizations that do not take the opportunity to apply lessons\nlearned and to better prepare for their next encounter with an adversary may well\nsuffer attacks that result in additional data loss, ransom demands, extortion or other\nmonetary losses requiring costly legal fees, response services and perhaps even\nfuture business interruption.\n\n###### CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND RESPONSE CHANGES THE GAME\n\nThe key metric in effectively dealing with ongoing and recurring attacks is the time\nit takes to remediate. Effective response and remediation of a threat first requires\ndetecting the threat, then performing the necessary investigation to scope and\nunderstand it, and finally taking the needed actions to remediate the threat. Of\ncourse, while the defenders are executing this playbook, adversaries are not\nstanding still. The fastest player wins this race.\n\n###### ATTACKER TIMELINE\n\n**Lateral**\n\n**Initial Access** **Persistence** **Discovery** **Objective**\n\n**Movement**\n\nDETECT UNDERSTAND CONTAIN ERADICATE\n\n###### INCIDENT RESPONSE TIMELINE\n\n**Figure 7. The Incident Response Race: First to the goal line wins!**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[*Source: CrowdStrike 2019 Global](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-security-attitude-survey-2019/)**\n**[Security Attitude Survey](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-security-attitude-survey-2019/)**\n\n\nCrowdStrike maintains a strong focus on acting quickly to stop a breach, clean up\nmalicious artifacts and help organizations get back to business quickly. CrowdStrike\nencourages organizations to strive to meet the 1-10-60 rule, where security teams\ndemonstrate the ability to detect threats within the first minute of an intrusion,\ninvestigate and understand the threat within 10 minutes, and contain and eradicate\nthe threat within 60 minutes.\n\nIn 2020, CrowdStrike introduced its Endpoint Recovery Services (ERS), specifically\ndesigned to help customers bring their core business operations back quickly while\nminimizing the risk of the attacker’s foothold within the environment. While traditional\nincident response focuses on understanding an attacker's activity and determining\nroot cause, ERS focuses on quickly removing malware and other artifacts from\ninfected systems, blocking malicious activity and closing holes so the attackers\ncannot get back in. CrowdStrike is seeing more organizations combine Incident\nResponse Services with ERS, which provides a powerful combination of detailed\nroot cause and impact (often demanded by cyber insurers and outside counsel)\nalong with fast and effective recovery. For more information, read this CrowdStrike\n[white paper, Intelligence-led Rapid Recovery.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/white-papers/intelligence-led-rapid-recovery/)\n\nOf course, the fastest way to handle intrusions is not to have one in the first place.\nThe most effective security teams handle intrusion attempts in near real time, as\nthey happen. At CrowdStrike, this is called “continuous monitoring and response”\n— and this mindset shifts the balance of power strongly in favor of the defender.\nContinuous monitoring and response requires a 24/7/365 security operations center\n(SOC) team that is empowered with the advanced technology and mature processes\nneeded to quickly and effectively handle all kinds of cyber threats.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon Complete team was created around this notion of\ncontinuous monitoring and response, and the team has built and optimized its\noperations to deliver security operations excellence for their global customer base.\n\n###### CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND INDUSTRY AVERAGE* RESPONSE WITH FALCON COMPLETE\n\nTime to Detect **120** hours **1** minute\n\nTime to Investigate **11** hours **6** minutes\n\nTime to Remediate **31** hours **29** minutes\n\n**Figure 8. Industry average time to detect, investigate and remediate vs. Falcon Complete, 2020**\n\nShifting SOC tactics from incident response to continuous monitoring and response\nis key to stopping breaches in 2021 and beyond. CrowdStrike encourages all organizations to examine their own response times and look for opportunities to lower\nthese metrics, turning the tables on the adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 49%\n###### OF INCIDENT RESPONSE SERVICES ENGAGEMENTS WERE BROUGHT TO CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES BY OUTSIDE COUNSEL\n\n\n###### OUTSIDE COUNSEL IS PLAYING A BIGGER ROLE IN THE INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCESS\n\nAs organizations become more mature and understand the risks associated with\nbreaches, they are careful that sensitive information about an incident does not fall\ninto the wrong hands or, if released, does not potentially increase the liability they\nface. When dealing with a data breach, it is becoming best practice to engage the\nincident response partner through outside counsel. When handling a cyber event,\nwork performed in order to gather information for the purpose of assisting an\nattorney in rendering legal advice may be protected under attorney-client privilege\nand/or work product doctrine, preventing it from being open to discovery in a\nlawsuit. Attorney-client privilege is designed to protect confidential communication\nbetween attorneys and their clients, and the work product doctrine precludes\ndisclosure of materials created at the direction of counsel specifically in preparation\nfor litigation.\n\nIn 2020, outside counsel engaged CrowdStrike Services to advise its clients in 49%\nof investigations. This trend has increased globally and will likely continue over the\nnext several years. While the same legal constructs do not exist in every country,\nmultinational organizations that conduct business in the United States or other\njurisdictions may want to consult outside legal counsel at the outset of an incident\nresponse to determine how best to engage an investigation firm.\n\nPreserving attorney-client privilege and work product protections during incident\nresponse and recovery engagements is no small task. If you are interested in\nunderstanding more about engaging CrowdStrike Services through outside counsel\nfor your next cyber investigation and incident recovery, read this paper developed\nby CrowdStrike Services in conjunction with representatives from an IT technical\n[services firm and a forensic accounting firm: Intelligence-led Rapid Recovery.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/white-papers/intelligence-led-rapid-recovery/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## KEY THEMES\n\nAs CrowdStrike’s teams of experts engage with clients around the world to contain\nand eradicate threats and drive more mature cybersecurity practices, patterns\nemerge. In addition to the findings already discussed, the CrowdStrike Services\nteam identified a number of key themes from the work performed across all\ncustomer engagements over the past year. This next section dives deep into the top\nsix key themes from 2020.\n### 56%\n###### OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS REPORTED WORKING FROM\n THEME 1: SECURITY IN SWEATPANTS: HOW WIDESPREAD\n HOME MORE\n REMOTE WORK CHANGES SECURITY\n OFTEN\n\n\n### 60%\n###### OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS ARE USING PERSONAL DEVICES WHILE WORKING REMOTELY*\n\n**[*Source: CrowdStrike 2020 Work](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/infographics/work-security-index-survey-results/)**\n**[Security Index Survey](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/infographics/work-security-index-survey-results/)**\n\n\nThe year 2020 brought quick and decisive digital transformations across industries\nin response to remote work requirements. During this “Great Pivot,” many\norganizations effectively turned their networks inside out to allow employees to\nwork from anywhere. This pivot also accelerated both the ongoing adoption of\ncloud technologies and the organizational support for hybrid working environments.\nSome organizations accomplished several years’ worth of digital transformation in a\nmatter of weeks. As a result, CrowdStrike saw more organizations seeking to move\naway from traditional on-premises cybersecurity solutions and toward cloud-centric\narchitectures. For these organizations especially, identity management and workload\nsecurity — including endpoints, cloud workloads, mobile devices, etc. — are crucially\nimportant.\n\n###### NETWORKS TURNED INSIDE OUT\n\nThe operational and architectural pivot to a work-from-anywhere model occurred\nunder extreme time and operational pressures, resulting in significant changes to\noperations and even network configurations themselves. Suddenly, organizational\nperimeters dramatically changed as employees began accessing network\nresources from new locations, and in some cases, with new devices. This pivot also\nforced organizations to change some of their own operations. For instance, many\ncompanies that did not previously permit remote access to corporate networks, like\nvirtual private networks (VPNs), suddenly found that they needed to enable these\ntechnologies to support a fully remote workforce.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attackers have consistently capitalized on new opportunities arising from security gaps or unintentional configuration errors.\n\n\nDespite the best efforts of the technology teams that implemented these changes,\nattackers have consistently capitalized on new opportunities arising from security\ngaps or unintentional configuration errors. In 2020, CrowdStrike Services\nresponded to multiple cases in which the transition to remote operations resulted in\nunauthorized remote access to internal systems. In some of these cases, companies\nhad adjusted configurations on corporate laptops to allow expanded use of VPN and\nRDP, but did not implement best practices to restrict activity to approved internal IP\naddresses or require the use of multifactor authentication.\n\n###### TARGETS NEW AND OLD\n\nIndividual users remain a significant target of opportunity for attackers seeking to\ninfiltrate organizations. However, the move to “work from anywhere” has expanded\nthe potential methods that attackers can employ to exploit users. CrowdStrike\ncontinues to observe attackers leveraging remote access credentials to gain access\nto target environments. Conversely, the pivot to remote work highlights the difficulty\nthat many security teams face in administering and patching systems when users\nare not required to connect to the domain with a VPN.\n\nMeanwhile, attackers also continue to exploit vulnerabilities that existed before\nwidespread remote work. Organizations that lack robust system configuration\ncontrols have faced challenges in applying patches, deploying security updates and\nperforming standard maintenance activities for devices. CrowdStrike has worked\nwith organizations that experienced attacks stemming from initial access gained\nthrough vulnerabilities in publicly exposed systems and applications.\n\n###### SECURITY AFTER THE GREAT PIVOT\n\nIn this work-from-anywhere landscape, security teams must remain vigilant in\nperforming the fundamentals of cybersecurity. Organizations that migrate to cloudcentric architectures must become more focused on implementing effective identityand device-based access controls, steering access controls toward a posture of\nZero Trust. All employees who participate in information security — from leadership\nto supporting team members — must clearly understand their roles and be ready\nto perform them, especially under these high-stakes conditions as organizations\ncontinue to transition to work from anywhere.\n\nCrowdStrike recommends the following practices:\n\n**\u0007Survey your battlefield. For security teams operating in this new**\nenvironment, visibility and speed are critical for blocking attackers that\nhave the capability and intent to steal data and disrupt operations. As\norganizations increasingly support work-from-anywhere operations, security\nteams must establish consistent visibility into on-premises and cloud\nenvironments and must proactively address potential vulnerabilities before\nthey can be leveraged by attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Local and cloud-hosted applications should be consistently patched,**\nand business-critical applications should be carefully monitored and\nmaintained.\n\n**\u0007Security teams should reinforce their understanding of externally facing**\ndevices by performing routine vulnerability and asset management scans.\n\n**\u0007All perimeter devices — including network DMZs, jump servers, and**\nweb and email servers — should be treated as high-risk systems and\nsubjected to security reviews equivalent to critical systems on the\nnetwork.\n\n**\u0007Security and infrastructure teams should ensure that externally facing**\nsystems are hardened by closing unnecessary ports and network\nservices, applying strict firewall policies and properly segmenting\nnetworks.\n\n**\u0007Access control policies should be applied and security teams should**\nmonitor for unauthorized attempts to access networks, such as through\nbrute-force vulnerability exploitation or similar techniques.\n\n**\u0007Security teams should be able to readily discover cloud assets, detect**\nmisconfigurations and quickly perform remediation in their cloud\nenvironments.\n\n**\u0007Establish Zero Trust controls for critical systems and data. CrowdStrike**\ncontinues to observe attackers focusing their attention on identitybased attacks, with diverse adversaries leveraging compromised or weak\ncredentials to evade detection and access “crown jewels” and critical\nsystems. The concept of Zero Trust security addresses the problem of\naccess exploitation by continuously vetting access requests to locally\nor cloud-hosted assets. While implementing Zero Trust may sound like a\ndaunting task, focusing on the fundamentals and closing the biggest gaps\nin your environment with Zero Trust principles have the most immediate\nimpact and can be achieved in a short amount of time. Organizations can\nachieve quick time-to-value with Zero Trust by focusing on privileged or\nover-privileged accounts, building a baseline of behavior based on access,\nand putting in prevention or conditional access in high-risk authentication\nscenarios (e.g., RDP access to Domain Controller, and service account\nRDP). Zero Trust may also include installing multifactor authentication on\nall systems that hold sensitive data or support key operations, enforcing\nleast-privilege access on sensitive systems, and reducing the size of\nnetwork zones through micro-segmentation. Zero Trust security typically\nalso involves real-time monitoring, both of potential misuse of sensitive\ncredentials and of suspicious system or data access patterns.\n\n**\u0007Don’t forget about controlling access and data within your cloud**\n**environments. Organizations that leverage cloud or hybrid environments**\nshould control and monitor access to these environments through a cloud\naccess security broker (CASB). Regardless of network architecture,\norganizations should provide their security teams with tools to monitor\nboth user access patterns and the movement of sensitive data. Ultimately,\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BGH ransomware variants have multiplied, evolved and become more sophisticated, with their proliferation going virtually unimpeded by legacy endpoint security tools.\n\n\norganizations should reevaluate all default access controls, removing\ntrusted sources and requiring all connections to be authenticated,\nauthorized and encrypted.\n\n**\u0007Test your operations with tailored exercises. Even if an organization’s**\nmove to “work from anywhere” has been relatively smooth, the pivot has\nlikely introduced subtle but significant changes to baseline security posture\nand response processes. For many companies, long-held assumptions\nabout security processes and workflows may no longer be true — at\nleast not in the way they were once understood. CrowdStrike has seen\norganizations gain significant value through remote exercises. Remotely\nhosted red team/blue team exercises highlight new operational challenges\n— and opportunities — for SOC teams responding to red team attacks.\nRemote tabletop exercises provide both technical and management teams\nwith crucial opportunities to rehearse incident response activities while\nall participants — including executives — are limited to virtual interactions.\nThe lessons learned through these proactive engagements pay significant\ndividends by keeping incident response and management teams alert\nto evolving threats, nimble in their response, and savvy regarding how\norganizational processes should evolve to meet current needs.\n\n###### THEME 2: RANSOMWARE ACTORS EVOLVE THEIR OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2020, CrowdStrike Services observed the continued evolution and proliferation\nof eCrime adversaries engaging in big game hunting (BGH) ransomware techniques.\nBGH was first observed by CrowdStrike in 2016 with the introduction of BOSS\nSPIDER’s Samas (aka SamSam) ransomware. In the years that followed, BGH\nransomware variants have multiplied, evolved and become more sophisticated,\nwith their proliferation going virtually unimpeded by legacy endpoint security tools.\nThe year 2020 was marked by the trend continuing at an accelerated rate. The\nadvancements by eCrime actors include refinement and application of high-pressure\nextortion tactics on victim organizations and the sharing or copying of new techniques\namong different ransomware groups, in addition to a marked increase in the number of\nransomware variants. These advancements all but ensure that ransomware will remain\na popular method for eCrime actors to monetize breaches in the foreseeable future.\n\n###### RANSOMWARE ACTORS INCREASE PRESSURE\n\nCrowdStrike Services observed eCrime adversaries utilizing various techniques to\nincrease pressure on victim organizations to pay their extortion. While in previous\nyears ransomware eCrime adversaries were rarely observed exfiltrating data, 2020\nwitnessed a widespread adoption of ransomware with data-leak extortion tactics\namong multiple eCrime groups. This method involves both encrypting a victim\norganization’s environment and also exfiltrating data with the threat to leak it if\nthe extortion demand is not paid. This tactic was initially observed by CrowdStrike\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelligence with OUTLAW SPIDER in May 2019. However, it was not until November\n2019, when TWISTED SPIDER adopted this technique, that it became a catalyst\nfor multiple other eCrime actors, many of which have created dedicated leak sites\nto threaten exfiltration and distribute data. CrowdStrike Intelligence performed\nresearch on known dedicated leak sites beginning in November 2019. The results of\nthis analysis depict growth throughout 2020 in terms of the number of leak sites and\nthe number of victim entities with data published on the leak sites.\n\n###### DATE\n\nSEP\n\nQTR3 AUG\n\nJUL\n\nJUN\n\nAffiliates of PINCHY SPIDER\n\nQTR2 MAY Affiliates of TRAVELING SPIDER\n\nCIRCUS SPIDER\nDOPPEL SPIDER\n\nAPR GRACEFUL SPIDER\n\nOperators of Egregor\n\nMAR Operators of LockBit\n\nOperators of MedusaLocker\nOperators of MountLocker\n\nQTR1 FEB\n\nOperators of Pysa\nOperators of Sekhmet\n\nJAN Operators of SunCrypt\n\nRIDDLE SPIDER\n\nDEC TWISTED SPIDER\n\nVIKING SPIDER\n\nQTR4 WIZARD SPIDER\n\nNOV\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\n###### COUNT\n\n**Figure 9. Number of times that eCrime adversary groups were observed publishing exfiltrated data on dedicated leak**\n**sites, Nov. 2019-Sept. 2020**\n\nIn engagements involving eCrime adversaries that use ransomware with data-leak\nextortion, CrowdStrike Services is regularly asked to perform incident response\ninvestigations to assist stakeholders by identifying data that was accessed and\nexfiltrated by threat actors. Frequently, CrowdStrike Services is able to identify the data\nexfiltrated prior to publication by the eCrime adversary, thereby giving stakeholders an\nopportunity to prepare.\n\nNot only has the number of eCrime dedicated leak sites grown, threat actors have also\nbecome more sophisticated in their methods of leaking the data. In general, eCrime\nadversaries will leak exfiltrated data slowly, saving what they perceive to be the most\nsensitive data for last in an effort to increase pressure on the victim organization to\n\n\n-----\n\npay the extortion, rather than posting all of the exfiltrated data at once. PINCHY\nSPIDER’s dedicated leak site frequently holds auctions to sell exfiltrated data.\nOthers, such as DOPPEL SPIDER’s leak site, utilize a countdown timer that triggers\nan increase in the ransom demand upon each expiration. CARBON SPIDER’s\nleak site automatically releases data on a pre-set timer, with the least sensitive\ndata leaked first and the most sensitive leaked last. There are also significant\ndifferences in the amount of data exfiltrated by threat actors. CrowdStrike Services\nhas observed DOPPEL SPIDER frequently exfiltrating only tens of gigabytes,\nwhile others — such as TRAVELING SPIDER and affiliates associated with Nemty\nX ransomware — exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data or more from victim\norganizations.\n\nIn addition to ransomware with data-leak extortion, CrowdStrike Services has\nidentified additional tactics by eCrime adversaries to increase pressure on the\nvictim to pay the ransom. During several recent incidents, the eCrime adversaries,\nafter deploying ransomware to the victim organization’s environment, have utilized\nstolen credentials to gain access to the victim organization’s email instance to\nsend extortion-related emails to users demanding payment to prevent exfiltrated\ndata from being leaked. In other instances, the eCrime adversaries have called and\nharassed employees of a victim organization following ransomware deployment.\nFinally, CrowdStrike also observed threat actors increase pressure for payment with\ncredible threats of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks if ransom payment is\nnot received.\n\n###### ECRIME ADVERSARIES COLLABORATE\n\nCrowdStrike has observed formal collaboration among eCrime adversaries as well\nas shared tactics. In June 2020, the self-named “Maze Cartel” was created when\nTWISTED SPIDER, VIKING SPIDER and the operators of LockBit ransomware\nentered into an apparent collaborative business arrangement. After this occurred,\nleaks associated with VIKING SPIDER’s Ragnar Locker began appearing on\nTWISTED SPIDER’s dedicated leak site and Maze ransomware began deploying\nransomware using common virtualization software, a tactic originally pioneered by\nVIKING SPIDER.\n\nIn addition to formal collaboration, CrowdStrike Services has observed new tactics\nused and spread among eCrime actors. One such tactic is the development and\ndeployment of an ELF ransomware binary that can be deployed to ESXi hosts for\nthe purpose of encrypting virtual systems. This tactic was initially observed being\nused by SPRITE SPIDER’s Defray777 ransomware in August 2020 and was quickly\nadopted by CARBON SPIDER, which utilized a similar tactic weeks later. In addition,\nmultiple eCrime adversaries share common exfiltration techniques. CrowdStrike has\nobserved multiple eCrime adversaries exfiltrating data through MegaSync as well as\nRclone, an open-source computer program.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TINY SPIDER**\n\nTinyPoS Operates\n\nOperates\n\n**MUMMY SPIDER** **LUNAR SPIDER**\n\n|Oper|ates|\n|---|---|\n\n|Oper|ates|\n|---|---|\n\n\nBitPaymer\n\n\n**DOPPEL SPIDER** Smoke Bot\n\nOperates Distributes Distributes DanaBot\n\nDoppelDridex\n\nOperates Distributes Distributes\n\nOperates Operates\n\nDoppelPaymer GandCrab REvil\n\n**SMOKY SPIDER** **SCULLY SPIDER**\n\nOperates Operates\n\n**PINCHY SPIDER**\n\n**Figure 10.

It is\nreasonable to expect that this trend will continue at an accelerated rate with the\nsame goal in mind — to apply as much pressure as possible to organizations to pay\never-larger extortion demands. CrowdStrike expects that eCrime adversaries will\ncontinue to refine their data-leak extortion ransomware tactics, develop increasingly\nsophisticated exfiltration tooling that can be deployed widely, and automate data\nexfiltration by searching for, identifying and exfiltrating sensitive data by keyword.\n\nLastly, CrowdStrike expects eCrime adversaries to continue pursuing targets of\nopportunity. Frequently, these are SMBs that rely heavily on legacy antivirus to\nprotect them, but many large organizations are being hit frequently, as threat actors\nsee a higher return on investment when targeting an organization that may have\nstronger defenses but is also likely to pay a higher ransom demand.\n\n###### WHAT CAN BE DONE?\n\nWhy is ransomware so prevalent in 2020? In short, ransomware with data extortion\nremains a lucrative tactic for eCrime adversaries to monetize their presence in\na victim organization’s network. Fueled by increasingly larger ransom demands,\neCrime adversaries continue to develop tactics and tools that allow them to slip\npast legacy antivirus virtually unnoticed. Following a ransomware incident, many\norganizations may find that they do not have adequate backups, or that their\nbackups became encrypted, and they have few options but to pay the ransom. In\naddition, some cyber insurance companies, during cost-benefit analysis, may find\nthat paying the ransom is a less costly option than rebuilding systems and incurring\ncredit monitoring and legal fees due to the disclosure of regulated data by an\neCrime adversary.\n\nCrowdStrike recommends the following practices:\n\n**\u0007Build a bulletproof backup strategy. When it comes to ransomware, how**\nyou’ve configured your backups is critical. Attackers often delete backups\nbefore deploying ransomware so you are more inclined to pay. Some\nsteps to consider include purchasing an immutable backup solution, using\nseparate non-domain accounts with multifactor authentication to administer\nyour backup solution, retaining multiple copies of data on different media\nwith one of them being off-site, keeping at least one copy of your backups\noffline or on an otherwise air-gapped network, and closely monitoring your\nbackup solution for evidence of data exfiltration, whether it’s on-premises or\nin the cloud. eCrime adversaries have publicly boasted about utilizing cloud\nbackups for data exfiltration, and CrowdStrike recommends taking steps\nto prevent threat actors from accessing cloud backup infrastructure in the\nevent of a compromise. This can involve using non-domain accounts for\ncloud management and multifactor authentication.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Use multifactor authentication. Organizations can improve their security**\nposture by enabling multifactor authentication on all public-facing employee\nservices and portals as well as restricting internet-facing protocols such as\nRDP and Server Message Block. This will inhibit unauthorized access to the\norganization’s environment.\n\n**\u0007Implement next-generation endpoint protection. Organizations can**\nimprove their security posture by utilizing advanced endpoint protection\nacross their environment. The agent should leverage machine learning to\nidentify anomalies and perform heuristic analysis, in addition to conducting\nantivirus and anti-malware activities in real time. The agent should be\ncapable of detection and prevention, allow for remote network containment\nof assets pending investigation and/or remediation, and detect unmanaged\nassets within the corporate environment.\n\n**\u0007Utilize a privileged account management solution. Organizations**\ncan improve their security posture by implementing privileged account\nmanagement (PAM) that securely containerizes and rotates credentials\nof privileged accounts such as local or domain administrators, service\naccounts and database accounts. The PAM should rotate credentials no\nlonger than every eight hours and be capable of alerting if credential reuse\nis attempted after their expiration, thereby inhibiting threat actor activity.\n\n**\u0007Know when to ask for help. In some instances, organizations become**\naware of threat actor activity within their environment but may lack the\nvisibility to address the problem or the right intelligence to understand the\nnature of the threat. Getting educated about the latest threats and knowing\nwhen to ask for help by activating an incident response team or retainer,\nsuch as those offered by CrowdStrike Services, may allow for detection\nand remediation before the threat actor is able to deploy ransomware or\nexfiltrate data from the environment.\n\n###### THEME 3: ADVERSARIES HAVE THEIR HEADS IN  THE CLOUD\n\nIn many organizations, the adoption of cloud infrastructure had happened to some\ndegree prior to the global pandemic. While the pandemic certainly accelerated the\nmove to the cloud for many organizations, with some electing to go all-in on cloud,\nother organizations continue to test the waters and gradually move certain services\nor capabilities into various cloud platforms. CrowdStrike is even seeing some\nearly cloud adopters moving from legacy cloud deployments to new architectures\nin the hope of gaining improvements in scalability, maintenance and security. No\nmatter where you are in your cloud journey, managing the security posture of cloud\nenvironments can play a critical role in preventing a breach.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne trend CrowdStrike saw in 2020 involved threat actors targeting cloud\ninfrastructure slated for retirement or simply neglected for various reasons.\nThis vulnerability likely stemmed from infrastructure no longer receiving security\nconfiguration updates and regular maintenance. Unfortunately, security controls\nlike monitoring, expanded logging, security architecture/planning and posture\nremediation no longer occurred in these environments.\n\nUnfortunately, CrowdStrike encountered cases where neglected cloud infrastructure\nstill contained critical business data and systems. As such, attacks led to sensitive\ndata leaks requiring costly investigation and reporting obligations. Additionally, some\nattacks on abandoned cloud environments resulted in impactful service outages,\nsince they still provided critical services that hadn’t been fully transitioned to new\ninfrastructure. Moreover, the triage, containment and recovery from the incident\nin these environments had a tremendous negative impact on some organizations\nas these activities disrupted the release of a key feature launch in one case and\ndelayed M&A activities in another.\n\n\nNot only did the Services team see cloud infrastructure as a target of attacks in\n2020, the cloud also served as a vehicle to launch attacks. Over the past year, threat\nactors leveraged common cloud services, like Microsoft Azure, and data storage\nsyncing services, like MEGA, to exfiltrate data and proxy network traffic. A lack of\noutbound restrictions coupled with a lack of workload protection enabled threat\nactors to interact with local services over proxies to IP addresses in the cloud.\nThis gave attackers additional time to interrogate systems and exfiltrate data from\nservices ranging from partner-operated web-based APIs to databases to custom\nnetwork services — all while appearing to originate from inside the victim’s network\nand barely leaving a trace on local file systems.\n\nKEY\n\nDATA EXFILTRATION\n\nATTACK ACTIVITY\n\n**Figure 11. Attackers leverage common cloud services to obfuscate malicious activity**\n\n|KEY|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|DATA EXFILTRATION||\n|ATTACK ACTIVITY||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WHAT CAN I DO TO PROTECT MY CLOUD ENVIRONMENT?\n\nThe cloud introduces new wrinkles to proper protection that don’t all translate exactly\nfrom a traditional on-premises data center model. Security teams should keep the\nfollowing firmly in mind as they strive to remain grounded in best practices.\n\n**\u0007Enable runtime protection and obtain real-time visibility. You can’t protect**\nwhat you don’t have visibility into — even if you have plans to decommission\nthe infrastructure. Central to securing your cloud infrastructure to prevent\na breach is runtime protection and visibility provided by cloud workload\nprotection (CWP). It remains critical to protect your workloads with nextgeneration endpoint protection, including servers, workstations and mobile\ndevices, regardless of whether they reside in an on-premises data center or\nvirtual cluster, or hosted in the cloud.\n\n**\u0007Eliminate configuration errors. The most common root cause of cloud**\nintrusions continues to be human errors and omissions introduced during\ncommon administrative activities. It’s important to set up new infrastructure\nwith default patterns that make secure operations easy to adopt. One way\nto do this is to use a cloud account factory to create new sub-accounts and\nsubscriptions easily. This strategy ensures that new accounts are set up in a\npredictable manner, eliminating common sources of human error. Also, make\nsure to set up roles and network security groups that keep developers and\noperators from needing to build their own security profiles and accidentally\ndoing it poorly.\n\n**\u0007Leverage a cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution. Ensure**\nyour cloud account factory includes enabling detailed logging and a CSPM\n— like CrowdStrike’s Falcon Horizon™ — with alerting to responsible parties\nincluding cloud operations and SOC teams. Actively seek out unmanaged\ncloud subscriptions, and when found, don’t assume it's managed by someone\nelse. Instead, ensure that responsible parties are identified and motivated\nto either decommission any shadow IT cloud environments or bring them\nunder full management along with your CSPM. Then use your CSPM\non all infrastructure up until the day the account or subscription is fully\ndecommissioned to ensure that operations teams have continuous visibility.\n\n###### THEME 4: WATCH FOR WEAKNESSES WITH PUBLIC- FACING APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES\n\nIn order for state-sponsored or criminally motivated adversaries to launch an attack,\nthey must gain initial access to an environment. In 2020, CrowdStrike Services\nobserved adversaries exploiting public-facing applications in 30% of investigated\ncases in order to gain initial access. The Services team witnessed adversaries\nfirsthand as they capitalized on new vulnerabilities, often within 24 to 48 hours after\nsecurity researchers publicly released proof-of-concept (POC) exploits.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 5\n###### COMMON WEAKNESSES WERE SEEN IN\n### 27%\n###### OF CROWDSTRIKE’S 2020 INCIDENT RESPONSE ENGAGEMENTS\n\n\nWhile attackers have always targeted internet-facing infrastructure, the volume of\nincidents that began this way in 2020 represents a shift in the threat landscape.\nSeveral factors likely fueled this shift, but three deserve particular attention.\n\n**\u0007The large number of published vulnerabilities: At the time of this**\nwriting, 2020 is on track to see approximately 19,000 newly published\nvulnerabilities, according to the National Vulnerability Database —\nrepresenting the most vulnerabilities ever published in a single year, up\nnearly 9% from 2019.\n\n**\u0007The critical nature and severity of the vulnerabilities identified in public-facing**\napplications in 2020 were a factor, such as those outlined in Table 3 below.\n\n**\u0007There was an acceleration and shift toward businesses offering more**\nexternal services as they pivoted to remote work models.\n\nIt’s important to note that application vulnerabilities are not the only way attackers\ngain initial access via publicly facing applications. In fact, attackers gained initial\naccess via remote login services exposed to the internet and with single-factor\nauthentication in 14% of the incidents investigated. Adversaries often achieved\nthis access via brute-force, password-spraying, or credential-stuffing attacks, or\npreviously compromised credentials likely purchased on dark web forums.\n\nThe most common exploits across all of the investigated incidents targeted remote\ncode execution vulnerabilities in Citrix ADC/NetScaler appliances and Microsoft\nSharePoint, as well as arbitrary read/write vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN and\nTelerik UI for ASP.NET. Other less common public-facing applications exploited\ninclude Microsoft Exchange, Zoho ManageEngine and ConnectWise. The top five\nmost common public-facing application vulnerabilities or remote external services\nthat CrowdStrike observed being exploited for initial access represent 27% of all\nincident response engagements that CrowdStrike conducted in 2020.\n\nRank Weakness Targeted Industries\n\n1 Exposed login service Agriculture, Defense, Financial, Government,\n(e.g., RDP) with single- Healthcare, Information Technology, Manufacturing,\nfactor authentication Professional Services, Retail\n\n2 Citrix ADC/Gateway Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Entertainment, Financial,\n(NetScaler) Government, Healthcare, Information Technology,\nCVE-2019-19781 Professional Services, Retail\n\n3 Pulse Secure VPN Defense, Education, Hospitality, Information\nCVE-2019-11510 Technology, Manufacturing, Professional Services,\nTelecommunications\n\n4 Telerik UI for ASP.NET Education, Healthcare, Information Technology\nCVE-2019-18935\n\n5 Microsoft SharePoint Education, Government, Retail\nCVE-2019-0604\n\n**Table 3.

Moreover, 16% of the time, these\nsame initial access techniques led to a breach of sensitive data such as intellectual\nproperty, personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information\n(PHI) or payment card information (PCI). Perimeter-facing vulnerabilities along\nwith applications that are not protected by multifactor authentication clearly bring\nsignificant financial impacts to businesses — system and network downtime was\nalso routinely observed.\n\n###### WHAT CAN BE DONE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON DEFENSES FOR PUBLIC-FACING APPLICATIONS?\n\nIn order to protect internet-facing applications, CrowdStrike recommends implementing the following best practices to mitigate adversaries obtaining initial access\nvia public-facing applications or external remote services.\n\n**\u0007Inventory your public-facing applications, services and systems.**\nOrganizations should have a complete inventory and understanding of\ntheir externally facing applications and remote access services, including\nthe software and versions running on them. They should incorporate this\ninventory into their asset management and vulnerability management\nprocesses. It’s impossible to defend systems you don’t know are there.\n\n**\u0007Patch vulnerable web applications. Applications and operating systems**\nshould be kept up-to-date by installing all vendor-released patches. In\nsituations where proof-of-concept exploits have been publicly released but\nvendor patches are not yet available, vendor mitigation steps should be\nimplemented.\n\n**\u0007Perform web application penetration tests. Organizations should have**\na third party conduct web application penetration tests to identify and fix\nvulnerabilities or misconfigurations that an attacker could exploit to gain\naccess.\n\n**\u0007Enforce multifactor authentication on public-facing applications**\n**and services, such as RDP and VPNs. Single-factor, password-based**\nauthentication is vulnerable to brute-force, password-spraying and credentialstuffing attacks. Multifactor authentication increases attacker complexity and\nincreases the likelihood of detection before a successful attack.\n\n**\u0007Restrict systems with remote login services such as RDP and Secure**\n**Shell (SSH) exposed to the internet. Allowing remote connections from all**\nexternal IP addresses greatly increases the chance of system compromise.\nSystems that require external-facing remote login for business purposes\nshould be restricted based on source IP address. Systems that do not\nrequire external-facing remote login for business purposes should have the\nservice disabled.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike Services saw state-sponsored adversaries target organizations ranging from 500 to 50,000+ endpoints across 10 industries.\n\n\n###### THEME 5: STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES LEAVE SMALLER FOOTPRINTS\n\nThe CrowdStrike Services team continued to respond to state-sponsored adversary\nintrusions at organizations throughout 2020. While many organizations think they\nmay not be a target of state-sponsored adversaries, some should think again. In\n2020, CrowdStrike saw state-sponsored adversaries target organizations ranging\nfrom 500 to 50,000+ endpoints across 10 industries. This section highlights key\ntrends observed to be employed by nation-state adversaries and also provides\nconsiderations for preventing and responding to nation-state adversaries.\n\n###### STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES EMPLOYED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF N-DAY VULNERABILITY EXPLOITS\n\nIn 2020, the CrowdStrike Services team observed state-sponsored actors achieving\naccess to target networks through supply chain attacks, physical access, wateringhole attacks, spear-phishing and via vulnerable public-facing applications. CrowdStrike\nServices observed heavy use of known vulnerabilities (“N-days”) to compromise\nexternally facing applications. Notably, CrowdStrike Services identified that nationstate actors leveraged the use of Pulse Secure VPN, Citrix ADC and Zoho Desktop\nCentral vulnerabilities in 2020. As mentioned, the exploitation of these vulnerabilities\noften came 24 to 48 hours after the release of POC code through open-source\nrepositories, demonstrating significant capabilities for rapid development.\n\n###### STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES PUT A BULLSEYE ON CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS\n\nIn 2020, CrowdStrike Services increasingly responded to incidents in which nationstate adversaries also targeted and compromised cloud infrastructure. In many\nof these cases, the actors were able to gain access to the environment either\nthrough credential theft in traditional on-premises systems or through improperly\nconfigured services. In addition, the Services team responded to incidents where\ntop commercial cloud providers were used as initial staging points to further blend in\nwith legitimate traffic.\n\nIn the previous edition of this report, the Services team noted that exposed cloud\napplication programming interface (API) keys with minimal restrictions and often a\nlack of additional auditing represented the bulk of intrusion cases involving cloud\ninfrastructure as a service (IaaS). In 2020, the Services team identified that in a\nsubset of incidents, the adversaries compromised the control plane of the tenant\nand performed actions-on-objectives tasks directly through the tenant console. The\nteam also observed them taking advantage of single-factor authentication access\nto IaaS consoles and leveraging Microsoft Azure to push Cobalt Strike beacons via\nPowerShell. During these incidents, preconfigured logging and enhanced auditing of\nindividual service components played a critical role in providing the Services team\nwith the ability to track and contain adversary actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES LEVERAGED INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED ATTACK TECHNIQUES WHILE LEAVING EXTREMELY SMALL FOOTPRINTS\n\nState-sponsored adversaries continue to blend in by using “living off the land”\n(LOTL) techniques both within traditional enterprise environments and in the cloud,\nas well as using custom implants that leave minimal artifacts for traditional forensic\nanalysis. In 2020, delivery of more sophisticated implants by nation-state actors\n— often leveraging memory- and modular-based implants — typically occurred\nthrough watering-hole attacks or supply-chain compromise. In a subset of these\ncases, the actors leveraged LOTL techniques and commodity toolsets (e.g., certutil,\nmsbuild, bits, Cobalt Strike, generic webshells, etc.), while others leveraged custom\nand some previously unknown implants to maintain persistence. Commonly, the\nidentified implants leveraged a multi-stage framework in which a minimal footprint\nwas maintained on the disk through a persistent loader. The implants were activated\nthrough preconfigured command-and-control channels, and subsequent payloads\nwere retrieved in a modular fashion that were loaded only in memory for execution\nto carry out their specific task.\n\nThese sophisticated techniques are one of the reasons why state-sponsored\nadversaries persist in networks much longer than average. Although the overall\ndwell time for incidents investigated by CrowdStrike Services decreased in 2020\ncompared to 2019 (from 95 days to 79 days), state-sponsored adversary dwell time\nsignificantly exceeded the overall average dwell time by a factor of nearly 10 — just\nunder two years. That means while the average attacker spent two to three months\nin a network before discovery, the average state-sponsored threat actor/group spent\nnearly two years in a network prior to discovery.\n\nWhen state-sponsored threats were identified, the availability of volatile evidence\nsuch as memory dumps and full network packet captures played a crucial role in\nenabling the CrowdStrike team to perform forensic analysis of systems affected by\nthe identified implants. Organizations with the visibility and infrastructure in place to\ncapture necessary telemetry during active operation periods played a critical role in\nenabling the Services team to successfully carry out the investigation and assist the\norganization in answering key questions related to the incident.\n\n###### PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS\n\nCrowdStrike recommends the following practices when defending against nationstate threat actors:\n\n**\u0007Establish strong IT hygiene with an asset inventory and consistent**\n**vulnerability management. Inventorying and patching external**\ninfrastructure on a regular basis increases the difficulty of initial access\nfor nation-state actors. Creating contingency plans for applications that\ncannot be immediately patched — such as increased monitoring, access\nrestrictions and backup applications — can help organizations reduce their\nrisk in situations where applications do not have patches available.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Protect your cloud infrastructure and workloads. Critical applications**\nand data are being moved to the cloud, and while organizations are\ngetting better at protecting their cloud environments, they continue to\nstrategically assess their security posture in traditional ways. Traditional\ntabletop assessments and red team engagements are no longer enough.\nOrganizations must adopt a cloud-focused assessment strategy to keep up\nwith the changing threat landscape. Cloud security assessment and cloudfocused tabletop assessments can identify gaps in cloud protections and\nlogging. Additionally, the CrowdStrike Falcon Horizon CSPM module can\nhelp organizations manage the security of their cloud workloads.\n\n**\u0007Establish a plan for a coordinated remediation event (CRE). With nation-**\nstate actors maintaining a longer dwell time than their eCrime counterparts,\norganizations must learn to manage longer-term incidents. Executing\ncontainment actions too quickly can result in the threat actor changing\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). And, containment actions can\nsometimes be impactful to a network, causing downtime or signaling your\nintent prior to the action being taken. A CRE is a detailed procedure for\nremoving a threat actor from the network in one fell swoop. Implementing a\nCRE plan prior to an incident can help organizations reduce the likelihood of\nre-compromise when defending against nation-state threat actors.\n\n**\u0007Develop an ongoing relationship with law enforcement agencies. It is**\ngood to have a relationship with law enforcement prior to a breach. While\nsome organizations may be wary of involving multiple external parties in an\ninvestigation, having a relationship with law enforcement can be a valuable\ntool during an investigation. A few things that law enforcement relationships\nmay offer:\n\n**\u0007Intelligence on threat actor groups**\n\n**\u0007Guidance on ransom payments**\n\n**\u0007Tracing of unauthorized payments**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\"\n\n\n###### THEME 6: AFTER THE BREACH: MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO STOP THE NEXT BREACH\n\nOver the years, there have been multiple permutations of the cybersecurity incident\nresponse lifecycle, but no matter how that model evolves, two things remain constant:\nIt starts with preparation and ends with applying lessons learned. These parts of the\nprocess don’t typically garner much attention — after all, the exciting stuff is what\nhappens in between. In 2020, however, CrowdStrike Services saw a growing number\nof organizations focusing intently on the post-incident period. The Services team also\nsaw them expand the scope of this process, focusing less narrowly on the specifics of\nthe incident and broadening the process to drive more holistic change.\n\n###### OPPORTUNITY FROM CRISIS\n\nA significant cyber breach can be devastating to an organization, and experiencing a\nsecond breach on the heels of the first is far more catastrophic. This is why business\nleaders always ask, “What are we doing to keep this from happening again?” It’s a\npivotal question, especially for a security team whose performance is likely under\na microscope. Mishandle it and you may never regain your leaders’ confidence.\nAnswer it well, and you will not only win back their trust but also lay the foundation\nfor a stronger security program moving forward.\n\nProviding a good answer requires expansive thinking, and perhaps an embrace of\nthe aphorism, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” In the wake of a major incident,\ncybersecurity awareness is high, risk tolerance is low, and past assumptions about\noperational and budgetary constraints are subject to change. While it is important to\naddress the root causes of the incident that occurred, it is a mistake to stop there.\nThe next incident is unlikely to exactly mirror the last one, and any improvement plan\nshould not only address the specific causes of the last incident but also weed out\nthe seeds of the next one.\n\n###### POST-INCIDENT PLANNING\n\nAny holistic response process is going to be a marathon, not a sprint — and the\ncourse of that marathon will be different for each organization. In most cases, the\nfollowing steps are certainly worth considering:\n\n**\u0007Expedite recovery. Before any plans for improvement can begin, it is**\nessential to secure and restore the environment quickly. Third-party\nassistance — such as CrowdStrike’s Endpoint Recovery Services — can\nstreamline the containment, remediation and recovery phases of an incident\nusing more streamlined and surgical workflows versus the traditional\napproach of rebuilding IT environments. This approach allows the business\nto get back to work more rapidly and less expensively, and allows the\nsecurity team to train its focus on making improvements.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Test new controls. Many remediation plans involve implementing new**\ncontrols, such as implementing multifactor authentication, updating firewall\nrules, changing group policy configurations or patching a key vulnerability.\nDepending on the nature of the new controls, it may be necessary to\nperform technical tests to verify they are working as intended.\n\n**\u0007Conduct a lessons-learned process. This is the traditional post-incident**\nreview, which focuses on identifying and understanding the root causes\nof the incident as well as understanding what went well and what did not\nduring the response. Although it is an indispensable part of the response\nlifecycle, it is by definition focused on the last battle and may or may not\nprovide useful insights for fighting the next one.\n\n**\u0007Secure executive buy-in. In the wake of a major incident, the security team**\nis going to be subject to additional scrutiny. Clear, open communication with\nleadership is critical to restoring their trust in a security program. Beyond\nexplaining “What happened?” to leadership, security leaders will be expected\nto explain “How will we prevent future incidents?” as well as “How do we know\nthat we’re taking the right approach?” Executives should be briefed on the way\nforward and updated at key points along that journey. By outlining a plan that\nincludes the steps below, the security team can give executives confidence\nthat security will take a broad, open-minded approach to making improvements.\nIt may also help to bring in third-party experts to attest to this approach and\nassure executives that the path forward you have charted is the right one.\n\n**\u0007Perform a technical assessment. The goal of a technical assessment**\nshould be to identify and understand factors about your organization’s\nnetwork that could make future incidents more or less likely. It is not a\npenetration test — presumably a threat actor just succeeded at that — but\nit may take different forms depending on the nature of the incident and\ninvestigation that occurred. For instance, if the investigation was confined\nto a specific network segment or specific business unit, an enterprise-wide\ncompromise assessment can give confidence that the attacker did not\nmove into parts of the environment that were beyond the scope of the initial\ninvestigation. If the prior investigation was thorough, consider an IT hygiene\nassessment to identify weak passwords, Active Directory configurations or\nmissed patches that could open the door to the next attacker.\n\n**\u0007Perform a programmatic assessment. The post-incident period is the**\nperfect time to evaluate a security program from top to bottom — and\nconsider the people, processes and technologies. The just-completed\nincident exposed some weaknesses but probably not all of them — and\npossibly not the most significant ones. A full assessment will help provide an\nobjective understanding of the security program’s current maturity, facilitate\nconversations about where it ought to be and prioritize which improvements\nto make first. It provides the prerequisite understanding before you can\neffectively answer “What are we doing to keep this from happening again?”\n\n**\u0007Develop a roadmap. The steps above are all likely to identify things your or-**\nganization can do to be more secure. Your roadmap should reflect which of\n\n\n-----\n\nthose changes you are going to prioritize and your timelines for completing\nthem. It’s important to take a risk-informed approach, prioritizing quick wins\nto show progress while also investing in the improvements that are going to\nmost significantly reduce your risk — even if they’re longer-term efforts.\n\n**\u0007Execute with accountability. Depending on the nature of the changes**\nan organization needs to make, executing on its roadmap may take years.\nThese long, complex improvement plans require careful management\nand checkpoints along the way to ensure everything remains on course.\nStrong project management can help track milestones and ensure plans\nstay on schedule. It may also be necessary to seek outside guidance,\nboth to ensure that the improvements you’re making are addressing the\nrisks they’re meant to and also to consider whether changes in the threat\nlandscape merit a realignment of priorities.\n\n**\u0007Test your progress. Once specific projects are completed, run tests**\nto ensure they are working. Use penetration tests to validate technical\ncontrols, and run exercises to test new processes.\n\n###### PREPARING FOR THE NEXT BATTLE\n\nIn some respects, the visual of the incident response lifecycle does security teams a\ndisservice. The notion of a “cycle” implies a circular path, where you return to where\nyou were before.\n\n###### THE INCIDENT RESPONSE LIFECYCLE\n\n\n###### DETECTION & ANALYSIS\n\n\n###### POST-INCIDENT ACTIVITIES\n\n\n###### CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION & RECOVERY\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PREPARATION\n\n POST-INCIDENT ACTIVITIES\n\n\nTaking a more expansive approach to the post-incident review process gives\nsecurity teams another path. Rather than circling back to the beginning, the aim\nis to arrive back at the pre-incident phase better equipped to stop incidents from\noccurring and respond effectively to those that do. The goal is not to eliminate\nsecurity incidents — it would be a grave mistake to promise such a thing to leaders\nwho ask about stopping the next one. The goal is to turn that cycle into an upward\nspiral, where future incidents are less frequent and less severe. At the apex of that\nspiral is the continuous monitoring and response process, where new threats are\nidentified and remediated in near real time.\n\n###### CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND RESPONSE\n\n Response Time\n\n DETECTION & ANALYSIS\n\n CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION & RECOVERY\n\n REACTIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\n\n###### Response Time\n\n DETECTION & ANALYSIS\n\n CONTAINMENT,\n\n\n-----\n\n## ABOUT CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES\n\nCrowdStrike Services equips\norganizations with the protection\nand expertise they need to defend\nagainst and respond to security\nincidents.
