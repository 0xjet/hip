    "plain_text": "# Cybercrime loves company: Conti cooperated with other ransomware gangs\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/conti-ransomware-cooperation-maze-lockbit-ragnar-locker](https://intel471.com/blog/conti-ransomware-cooperation-maze-lockbit-ragnar-locker)**\n\nSoftware developers often depend on the collective knowledge of the industry to build their\nproducts. Whether it's through reverse engineering, poaching talent, or straight up cloning\nthings, developers often lean on this collective knowledge to build operating systems, social\nmedia services, messaging applications or many other kinds of software.\n\nRansomware gangs are apparently no different. Thanks to the Conti Leaks, Intel 471\nresearchers found evidence that the Conti ransomware group kept a close eye on other\nransomware groups and borrowed some of their techniques and best practices for its own\noperations. Additionally, Intel 471 also observed the Conti group’s affiliates and managers\ncooperating with other gangs, which included the LockBit, Maze and Ryuk teams.\n\nFrom reworking encryption algorithms, to copying sections of ransom notes, to using\ndevelopers that worked on several different kinds of ransomware, Intel 471 found that Conti’s\noperations were powered by information gleaned from competitors.\n\n## Ryuk\n\nThe Conti and Ryuk ransomware strains have widely been attributed to the same group, with\nRyuk likely serving as a predecessor to Conti.\n\nThe metamorphosis of this strain has been debated for some time. Some research\nhypothesizes that Ryuk ransomware operators initially joined the Conti team as its own\ndivision in order to use TrickBot to distribute Ryuk, while others believe Conti was just a rework of Ryuk.\n\nHowever the metamorphosis occurred, it’s clear from the Conti Leaks chats that top-level\nConti operatives had direct access to actors who were behind Ryuk. Intel 471 researchers\nfound conversations tied to one of Conti’s senior managers that contained multiple\nreferences to the group behind Ryuk.\n\nFor example, on June 23, 2020, the senior manager discussed a Bleeping Computer article\nwhere researchers pointed at the Ryuk ransomware gang’s slowdown in operations. The\nmanager told another top associate that the Ryuk gang’s operations would soon return to\nnormal (Ed. Note: Handles have been changed to mask true identities):\n\n\n-----\n\nOn July 16, 2020, the two actors revealed their plans to use money earned from Ryuk\nransomware campaigns to cover rent and other expenses (translated from Russian):\n\nOn Aug. 26, 2020, the two actors discussed compensation and recruitment issues pertaining\nto the Ryuk team (translated from Russian):\n\nThese chats, among others, show that high-level Conti managers were knowledgeable about\nRyuk ransomware operations and most likely had direct access to the threat actors using it.\n\n## Maze\n\nIntel 471 researchers found chats that revealed Conti’s alleged coder claimed to have copied\nfeatures from Maze ransomware while developing Conti.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, the head developer had a conversation with the senior manager, claiming\nto have changed the Conti’s cryptographic algorithm from the AES-256 block cipher to the\nChaCha20 stream cipher, which increased encryption speed:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn July 8, 2020, another top developer communicated with the senior manager, claiming\nthat a Maze ransomware developer provided access to the group’s administrative panel.\n\nAlso in early July 2020, Conti group members revealed they used Maze ransomware as a\ntemporary stopgap while Conti was in development. (translated from Russian):\n\nA few weeks later, Conti was in steady use, becoming one of the most active ransomware\nstrains in the latter half of the year.\n\n## LockBit 2.0\n\nOur researchers found that in November 2021, two high-level Conti managers discussed a\npartnership with LockBit 2.0. The two managers apparently initially disagreed on the\npartnership’s details, later clarifying it in a leaked conversation:\n\nThis conversation lines up with what a LockBit 2.0 representative shared on an underground\nforum in April 2022, where they admitted that they had been in contact with Conti\nrepresentatives primarily due to interest in using TrickBot.\n\n## Ragnar Locker\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Sept. 27, 2021, Conti s open source intelligence (OSINT) team leader had a conversation\nthat revealed he updated the group’s ransom note by copying a portion of the text from the\nRagnar Locker ransom note.\n\nHere is the comparison of what victims would get from each ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware gangs do not operate in a vacuum. While each gang wants to make as much\nmoney as possible, there is a level of cooperation and partnership that each gang uses to\nultimately boost their ill-gotten gains. While legitimate companies are also profit-driven, they\nwill often create partnerships or collaborate with each other as a way to be successful. Given\nall of the other ways ransomware gangs have followed a legitimate business model, it should\nnot be surprising that they would strike accords or lean on each other in order to make as\nmuch money as possible.\n\n\n-----",
