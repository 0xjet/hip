This also includes domains used to load Javascript sources for specific\nWordPress plugins.\n\nFor whatever reason, a vendor may allow their domain’s registration to expire, which means\nit can become available for an attacker (or anyone else) to register it.\n\nAttackers typically perform reconnaissance to ascertain whether or not a domain is valuable\nto them. For example, if the expired domain is used within a plugin to load a Javascript\nresource, then it would make it a perfect target.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe recently found this exact scenario with the now defunct WordPress plugin visual**website-editor and its domain tidioelements[.]com, which was kindly reported to us by a**\nwebsite owner that encountered suspicious activity while using it.\n\nThe landing page for tidioelements[.]com in 2015, back when it was still an active plugin\nwebsite.The attacker’s strategy relies on the fact that some websites might still have the\nplugin installed and activated, and continue to load resources from the expired domain.\nOnce the attacker has registered the domain, they can then “assume” control by replacing\nany legitimate Javascript resources with something malicious.\n\nThe plugin won’t know that the domain has expired or that the Javascript resource is now\nloading from an attacker’s server — the only information it has is the URL to the Javascript\nresource, which it tries to include wherever the plugin is loaded.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe project was abandoned and is no longer available for download in the WordPress\nrepository. Nevertheless, attackers were able to take advantage of the expired domain to\nload arbitrary content, which highlights the importance of keeping all software updated and\nremoving any old plugins that aren’t actively used in your environment. Another important tip\nto [harden your website is to only use resources from official and reputable sources.](https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/10/top-10-website-hardening-tips.html)\n\n\n-----",
