It is a trojan purely used for targeted remote control.\n\n**• Evidence shows in high probability that the malware is used in targeted attacks for**\nvictims who are already under the attacker’s control, or have gone through a heavy\nreconnaissance.\n\n**• HiddenWasp authors have adopted a large amount of code from various publicly**\navailable open-source malware, such as Mirai and the Azazel rootkit. In addition, there\nare some similarities between this malware and other Chinese malware families,\nhowever the attribution is made with low confidence.\n\n**• We have detailed our recommendations for preventing** **and** **responding** **to this**\n**threat.**\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nAlthough the Linux threat ecosystem is crowded with IoT DDoS botnets and cryptomining malware, it is not very common to spot trojans or backdoors in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike Windows malware, Linux malware authors do not seem to invest too much effort\nwriting their implants. In an open-source ecosystem there is a high ratio of publicly\navailable code that can be copied and adapted by attackers.\n\nIn addition, Anti-Virus solutions for Linux tend to not be as resilient as in other platforms.\nTherefore, threat actors targeting Linux systems are less concerned about implementing\nexcessive evasion techniques since even when reusing extensive amounts of code,\nthreats can relatively manage to stay under the radar.\n\nNevertheless, malware with strong evasion techniques do exist for the Linux platform.\nThere is also a high ratio of publicly available open-source malware that utilize strong\nevasion techniques and can be easily adapted by attackers.\n\nWe believe this fact is alarming for the security community since many implants today\nhave very low detection rates, making these threats difficult to detect and respond to.\n\nWe have discovered further undetected Linux malware that appear to be enforcing\nadvanced evasion techniques with the use of rootkits to leverage trojan-based implants.\n\nIn this blog we will present a technical analysis of each of the different components that\nthis new malware, HiddenWasp, is composed of. We will also highlight interesting codereuse connections that we have observed to several open-source malware.\n\nThe following images are screenshots from VirusTotal of the newer undetected malware\nsamples discovered:\n\n**2. Technical Analysis**\n\nWhen we came across these samples we noticed that the majority of their code was\nunique:\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to the recent Winnti Linux variants reported by [Chronicle, the infrastructure of this](https://medium.com/chronicle-blog/winnti-more-than-just-windows-and-gates-e4f03436031a)\nmalware is composed of a user-mode rootkit, a trojan and an initial deployment script.\nWe will cover each of the three components in this post, analyzing them and their\ninteractions with one another.\n\n**2.1 Initial Deployment Script:**\n\nWhen we spotted these undetected files in VirusTotal it seemed that among the\nuploaded artifacts there was a bash script along with a trojan implant binary.\n\nWe observed that these files were uploaded to VirusTotal using a path containing the\nname of a Chinese-based forensics company known as Shen Zhou Wang Yun\nInformation Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nFurthermore, the malware implants seem to be hosted in servers from a physical server\nhosting company known as ThinkDream located in Hong Kong.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong the uploaded files, we observed that one of the files was a bash script meant to\ndeploy the malware itself into a given compromised system, although it appears to be for\ntesting purposes:\n\nThanks to this file we were able to download further artifacts not present in VirusTotal\nrelated to this campaign. This script will start by defining a set of variables that would be\nused throughout the script.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong these variables we can spot the credentials of a user named ‘sftp’, including its\nhardcoded password. This user seems to be created as a means to provide initial\npersistence to the compromised system:\n\nFurthermore, after the system’s user account has been created, the script proceeds to\nclean the system as a means to update older variants if the system was already\ncompromised:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script will then proceed to download a tar compressed archive from a download\nserver according to the architecture of the compromised system. This tarball will contain\nall of the components from the malware, containing the rootkit, the trojan and an initial\ndeployment script:\n\nAfter malware components have been installed, the script will then proceed to execute\nthe trojan:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see that the main trojan binary is executed, the rootkit is added to\nLD_PRELOAD path and another series of environment variables are set such as the\n‘I_AM_HIDDEN’. We will cover throughout this post what the role of this environment\nvariable is. To finalize, the script attempts to install reboot persistence for the trojan\nbinary by adding it to /etc/rc.local.\n\nWithin this script we were able to observe that the main implants were downloaded in the\nform of tarballs. As previously mentioned, each tarball contains the main trojan, the\nrootkit and a deployment script for x86 and x86_64 builds accordingly.\n\nThe deployment script has interesting insights of further features that the malware\nimplements, such as the introduction of a new environment variable\n‘HIDE_THIS_SHELL’:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found some of the environment variables used in a open-source rootkit known as\n[Azazel.](https://github.com/chokepoint/azazel/search?q=HIDE_THIS_SHELL&unscoped_q=HIDE_THIS_SHELL)\n\nIt seems that this actor changed the default environment variable from Azazel, that one\nbeing HIDE_THIS_SHELL for I_AM_HIDDEN. We have based this conclusion on the\nfact that the environment variable HIDE_THIS_SHELL was not used throughout the rest\nof the components of the malware and it seems to be residual remains from Azazel\noriginal code.\n\nThe majority of the code from the rootkit implants involved in this malware infrastructure\nare noticeably different from the original Azazel project. Winnti Linux variants are also\nknown to have reused code from this open-source project.\n\n**2.2 The Rootkit:**\n\nThe rootkit is a user-space based rootkit enforced via LD_PRELOAD linux mechanism.\n\nIt is delivered in the form of an ET_DYN stripped ELF binary.\n\nThis shared object has an DT_INIT dynamic entry. The value held by this entry is an\naddress that will be executed once the shared object gets loaded by a given process:\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin this function we can see that eventually control flow falls into a function in charge\nto resolve a set of dynamic imports, which are the functions it will later hook, alongside\nwith decoding a series of strings needed for the rootkit operations.\n\nWe can see that for each string it allocates a new dynamic buffer, it copies the string to it\nto then decode it.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt seems that the implementation for dynamic import resolution slightly varies in\ncomparison to the one used in [Azazel rootkit.](https://github.com/chokepoint/azazel/blob/master/config.py)\n\nWhen we wrote the script to simulate the cipher that implements the string decoding\nfunction we observed the following algorithm:\n\nWe recognized that a similar\nalgorithm to the one above was\nused in the past by [Mirai, implying](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L963)\nthat authors behind this rootkit may\nhave ported and modified some\ncode from Mirai.\n\nAfter the rootkit main object has been loaded into the address space of a given process\nand has decrypted its strings, it will export the functions that are intended to be hooked.\nWe can see these exports to be the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nFor every given export, the rootkit will hook and implement a specific operation\naccordingly, although they all have a similar layout. Before the original hooked function is\ncalled, it is checked whether the environment variable ‘I_AM_HIDDEN’ is set:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see an example of how the rootkit hooks the function fopen in the following\nscreenshot:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have observed that after checking whether the ‘I_AM_HIDDEN’ environment variable\nis set, it then runs a function to hide all the rootkits’ and trojans’ artifacts. In addition,\nspecifically to the fopen function it will also check whether the file to open is\n‘/proc/net/tcp’ and if it is it will attempt to hide the malware’s connection to the cnc by\nscanning every entry for the destination or source ports used to communicate with the\ncnc, in this case 61061. This is also the default port in [Azazel rootkit.](https://github.com/chokepoint/azazel/blob/master/config.py)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe rootkit primarily implements artifact hiding mechanisms as well as tcp connection\nhiding as previously mentioned. Overall functionality of the rootkit can be illustrated in\nthe following diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.3 The Trojan:**\n\nThe trojan comes in the form of a statically linked ELF binary linked with stdlibc++. We\nnoticed that the trojan has code connections with ChinaZ’s Elknot implant in regards to\nsome common MD5 implementation in one of the statically linked libraries it was linked\nwith:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, we also see a high rate of shared strings with other known ChinaZ malware,\nreinforcing the possibility that actors behind HiddenWasp may have integrated and\nmodified some MD5 implementation from Elknot that could have been shared in Chinese\nhacking forums:\n\nWhen we analyze the main we noticed that the first action the trojan takes is to retrieve\nits configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware configuration is appended at the end of the file and has the following\nstructure:\n\nThe malware will try to load itself from the disk and parse this blob to then retrieve the\nstatic encrypted configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce encryption configuration has been successfully retrieved the configuration will be\ndecoded and then parsed as json.\n\nThe cipher used to encode and decode the configuration is the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis cipher seems to be an RC4 alike algorithm with an already computed PRGA\ngenerated key-stream. It is important to note that this same cipher is used later on in the\nnetwork communication protocol between trojan clients and their CNCs.\n\nAfter the configuration is decoded the following json will be retrieved:\n\nMoreover, if the file is running as root, the malware will attempt to change the default\nlocation of the dynamic linker’s LD_PRELOAD path. This location is usually at\n/etc/ld.so.preload, however there is always a possibility to patch the dynamic linker\nbinary to change this path:\n\n\n-----\n\nPatch_ld function will scan for any existent /lib paths. The scanned paths are the\nfollowing:\n\nThe malware will attempt to find the dynamic linker binary within these paths. The\ndynamic linker filename is usually prefixed with ld-<version number>.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the dynamic linker is located, the malware will find the offset where the\n/etc/ld.so.preload string is located within the binary and will overwrite it with the path of\nthe new target preload path, that one being /sbin/.ifup-local.\n\nTo achieve this patching it will execute the following formatted string by using the xxd\nhex editor utility by previously having encoded the path of the rootkit in hex:\n\nOnce it has changed the default LD_PRELOAD path from the dynamic linker it will\ndeploy a thread to enforce that the rootkit is successfully installed using the new\nLD_PRELOAD path. In addition, the trojan will communicate with the rootkit via the\nenvironment variable ‘I_AM_HIDDEN’ to serialize the trojan’s session for the rootkit to\napply evasion mechanisms on any other sessions.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter seeing the rootkit’s functionality, we can understand that the rootkit and trojan work\ntogether in order to help each other to remain persistent in the system, having the rootkit\nattempting to hide the trojan and the trojan enforcing the rootkit to remain operational.\nThe following diagram illustrates this relationship:\n\nContinuing with the execution flow of the trojan, a series of functions are executed to\nenforce evasion of some artifacts:\n\n\n-----\n\nThese artifacts are the following:\n\nBy performing some OSINT regarding these artifact names, we found that they belong to\na Chinese open-source rootkit for Linux known as [Adore-ng hosted in GitHub:](https://github.com/yaoyumeng/adore-ng)\n\nThe fact that these artifacts are being searched for suggests that potentially targeted\nLinux systems by these implants may have already been compromised with some\nvariant of this open-source rootkit as an additional artifact in this malware’s\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure. Although those paths are being searched for in order to hide their\npresence in the system, it is important to note that none of the analyzed artifacts related\nto this malware are installed in such paths.\n\nThis finding may imply that the target systems this malware is aiming to intrude may be\nalready known compromised targets by the same group or a third party that may be\ncollaborating with the same end goal of this particular campaign.\n\nMoreover, the trojan communicated with a simple network protocol over TCP. We can\nsee that when connection is established to the Master or Stand-By servers there is a\nhandshake mechanism involved in order to identify the client.\n\nWith the help of this function we where able to understand the structure of the\ncommunication protocol employed. We can illustrate the structure of this communication\nprotocol by looking at a pcap of the initial handshake between the server and client:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe noticed while analyzing this protocol that the Reserved and Method fields are always\nconstant, those being 0 and 1 accordingly. The cipher table offset represents the offset in\nthe hardcoded key-stream that the encrypted payload was encoded with. The following\nis the fixed keystream this field makes reference to:\n\nAfter decrypting the traffic and analyzing some of the network related functions of the\ntrojan, we noticed that the communication protocol is also implemented in json format. To\nshow this, the following image is the decrypted handshake packets between the CNC\nand the trojan:\n\nAfter the handshake is completed, the trojan will proceed to handle CNC requests:\n\n\n-----\n\nDepending on the given requests the malware will perform different operations\naccordingly. An overview of the trojan’s functionalities performed by request handling are\nshown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.3. Prevention and Response**\n\n**Prevention: Block Command-and-Control IP addresses detailed in the IOCs section.**\n\n**Response: We have provided a** [YARA rule intended to be run against in-memory](https://github.com/intezer/yara-rules/blob/master/HiddenWasp.yar)\nartifacts in order to be able to detect these implants.\n\nIn addition, in order to check if your system is infected, you can search for “ld.so” files —\nif any of the files do not contain the string ‘/etc/ld.so.preload’, your system may be\ncompromised. This is because the trojan implant will attempt to patch instances of ld.so\nin order to enforce the LD_PRELOAD mechanism from arbitrary locations.\n\n**4. Summary**\n\nWe analyzed every component of HiddenWasp explaining how the rootkit and trojan\nimplants work in parallel with each other in order to enforce persistence in the system.\n\nWe have also covered how the different components of HiddenWasp have adapted\npieces of code from various open-source projects. Nevertheless, these implants\nmanaged to remain undetected.\n\nLinux malware may introduce new challenges for the security community that we have\nnot yet seen in other platforms. The fact that this malware manages to stay under the\nradar should be a wake up call for the security industry to allocate greater efforts or\nresources to detect these threats.\n\nLinux malware will continue to become more complex over time and currently even\ncommon threats do not have high detection rates, while more sophisticated threats have\neven lower visibility.\n\n**IOCs**\n\n103.206.123[.]13\n\n103.206.122[.]245\n\nhttp://103.206.123[.]13:8080/system.tar.gz\n\nhttp://103.206.123[.]13:8080/configUpdate.tar.gz\n\nhttp://103.206.123[.]13:8080/configUpdate-32.tar.gz\n\ne9e2e84ed423bfc8e82eb434cede5c9568ab44e7af410a85e5d5eb24b1e622e3\n\nf321685342fa373c33eb9479176a086a1c56c90a1826a0aef3450809ffc01e5d\n\nd66bbbccd19587e67632585d0ac944e34e4d5fa2b9f3bb3f900f517c7bbf518b\n\n0fe1248ecab199bee383cef69f2de77d33b269ad1664127b366a4e745b1199c8\n\n2ea291aeb0905c31716fe5e39ff111724a3c461e3029830d2bfa77c1b3656fc0\n\nd596acc70426a16760a2b2cc78ca2cc65c5a23bb79316627c0b2e16489bf86c0\n\n609bbf4ccc2cb0fcbe0d5891eea7d97a05a0b29431c468bf3badd83fc4414578\n\n8e3b92e49447a67ed32b3afadbc24c51975ff22acbd0cf8090b078c0a4a7b53d\n\nf38ab11c28e944536e00ca14954df5f4d08c1222811fef49baded5009bbbc9a2\n\n8914fd1cfade5059e626be90f18972ec963bbed75101c7fbf4a88a6da2bc671b\n\n\n-----\n\nBy Ignacio Sanmillan\nNacho is a security researcher specializing in reverse engineering and malware analysis.\nNacho plays a key role in Intezer's malware hunting and investigation operations,\nanalyzing and documenting new undetected threats.
