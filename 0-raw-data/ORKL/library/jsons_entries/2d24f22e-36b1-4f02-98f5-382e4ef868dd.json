As part of their activities, this group hacks into exploitable routers and changes their\n\n\n-----\n\nDNS configuration. This allows the attackers to redirect the router user s traffic to malicious\nAndroid apps disguised as Facebook and Chrome or to Apple phishing pages that were\nused to steal Apple ID credentials.\n\nRecently, Kaspersky has discovered that this group is testing a new monetization scheme\nby redirecting iOS users to pages that contain the Coinhive in-browser mining script rather\nthan the normal Apple phishing page. When users are redirected to these pages, they will\nbe shown a blank page in the browser, but their CPU utilization will jump to 90% or higher.\n\n**Blank page utilizing**\n\n**Coinhive**\nThis is caused by the page utilizing the Coinhive mining script shown below.\n\n**Coinhive Mining Script**\nThe day after the GReAT discovered this new page, the attackers reverted back to\nredirecting to the Apple phishing page, so this appears to be a test that is not ready for full\nrelease.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Limited hacking of Japanese devices\n\nAfter Japanese researchers started releasing reports regarding Roaming Mantis, the group\nis making an effort to avoid hacking Japanese devices.\n\nOn landing pages that users were redirected to, Kaspersky noticed that there was\nJavaScript that checked if the device's language was set to \"ja\" or Japanese. If the ja\nlanguage was detected, the page would not offer any malicious applications or redirects to\nthe visitor.\n\n**Checking**\n\n**for Japanese Browser Language**\n\n## Spreading via scam adverts on Prezi.com\n\nThis group appears to also be taking a page out of the Adware handbook by promoting\nscam sites for adult videos, games, music, and downloads.\n\nThese scam sites are being promoted through Prezi.com, a presentation sharing site,\nwhere the group would create page that contain links to URLS at https://tinyurl.com. When\na visitor goes to these urls, though, they will be redirected to various scam sites as shown\nbelow.\n\n**Prezi.com Ads**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protecting your devices\n\nTo protect yourself from attacks like this, make sure that your routers are upgraded to the\nlatest firmware so that any vulnerabilities are patched. Kaspersky also suggests that\nAndroid users turn off the ability to install app from third-party sites.\n\n\"We strongly recommend that Android users turn off the option that allows installation of\napplications from third-party repositories, to keep their device safe,\" stated Kaspersky's\nresearch. \"They should also be suspicious if their phones become unusually hot, which may\nbe a side-effect of the hidden crypto-mining application in action.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Newly found zero-click iPhone exploit used in NSO spyware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/newly-found-zero-click-iphone-exploit-used-in-nso-spyware-attacks/)\n\n[Protect your iPhone's data with this backup software deal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/protect-your-iphones-data-with-this-backup-software-deal/)\n\n[Apple emergency update fixes zero-days used to hack iPhones, Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-emergency-update-fixes-zero-days-used-to-hack-iphones-macs/)\n\n[Verblecon malware loader used in stealthy crypto mining attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verblecon-malware-loader-used-in-stealthy-crypto-mining-attacks/)\n\n[Coinhive](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/coinhive/)\n[iOS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ios/)\n[iPhone](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/iphone/)\n[Miner](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/miner/)\n[Roaming Mantis Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/roaming-mantis-group/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
