A therapeutic postmortem of connected medicine\n\n**[securelist.com/time-of-death-connected-medicine/84315/](https://securelist.com/time-of-death-connected-medicine/84315/)**\n\nAuthors\n\n[Denis Makrushin](https://securelist.com/author/denisma/)\n\n[Yury Namestnikov](https://securelist.com/author/yurynamestnikov/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_cQvN7nUFNo\n\n**_#TheSAS2017 presentation: Smart Medicine Breaches Its “First Do No Harm” Principle_**\n\nAt last year’s Security Analyst Summit 2017 we predicted that medical networks would be a\ntitbit for cybercriminals. Unfortunately, we were right. The numbers of medical data breaches\nand leaks are increasing. According to public data, this year is no exception.\n\nFor a year we have been observing how cybercriminals encrypt medical data and demand a\nransom for it. How they penetrate medical networks and exfiltrate medical information, and\nhow they find medical data on publicly available medical resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The number of medical data breaches and leaks per year (source: HIPAA Journal)_\n\n## Opened doors in medical networks\n\nTo find a potential entry point into medical infrastructure, we extract the IP ranges of all\norganizations that have the keywords “medic”, “clinic”, “hospit”, “surgery” and “healthcare” in\nthe organization’s name, then we start the masscan (port scanner) and parse the specialized\nsearch engines (like Shodan and Censys) for publicly available resources of these\norganizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Masscan report extract_\n\nOf course, medical perimeters contain a lot of trivial opened ports and services: like webserver, DNS-server, mail-server etc. And you know that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The most\ninteresting part is the non-trivial ports. We left out trivial services, because as we mentioned\nin [our previous article those services are out of date and need to be patched. For example,](https://securelist.com/the-mistakes-of-smart-medicine/77855/)\nthe web applications of electronic medical records that we found on the perimeters in most\ncases were out of date.\n\nThe most popular ports are the tip of the iceberg. The most interesting part is the non-trivial\nports.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The most popular opened ports on medical perimeters (18,723 live hosts; 27,716 opened ports)_\n\nUsing ZTag tool and Censys, we identify what kinds of services are hidden behind these\nports. If you try to look deeper in the embedded tag you will see different stuff: for example\nprinters, SCADA-type systems, NAS etc.\n\n_Top services on medical network perimeters_\n\n\n-----\n\nExcluding these trivial things, we found Building Management systems that out of date.\nDevices using the Niagara Fox protocol usually operate on TCP ports 1911 and 4911. They\nallow us to gather information remotely from them, such as application name, Java version,\nhost OS, time zone, local IP address, and software versions involved in the stack.\n\n_Example of extracted information about Niagara Fox service_\n\nOr printers that have a web interface without an authentication request. The dashboard\n[available online and allows you to get information about internal Wi-Fi networks or, probably,](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/wi-fi/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nit allows you to get info about documents that appeared in “Job Storage” logs.\n\n\n-----\n\nShodan told us that some medical organizations have an opened port 2000. It’s a smart\nkettle. We don’t know why, but this model of kettle is very popular in medical organizations.\nAnd they have publicly available information about a vulnerability that allows a connection to\nthe kettle to be established using a simple pass and to extract info about the current Wi-Fi\nconnection.\n\n\n-----\n\nMedical infrastructure has a lot of medical devices, some of them portable. And devices like\nspirometers or blood pressure monitors support the MQTT protocol to communicate with\nother devices directly. One of the main components of the MQTT communication – brokers\n(see [here for detailed information about components) are available through the Internet and,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT)\nas a result, we can find some medical devices online.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Not only Smart Home components, but also medical devices are available via MQTT Spirometer_\n\n## Threats that affect medical networks\n\nOK, now we know how they get in. But what’s next? Do they search for personal data, or\nwant to get some money with a ransom or maybe something else? Money? It’s possible…\nanything is possible. Let’s take a look at some numbers that we collected during 2017.\n\nThe statistics are a bit worrying. More than 60% of medical organizations had some kind of\nmalware on their servers or computers. The good news is that if we count something here, it\nmeans we’ve deleted malware in the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Attacks detected in medical organizations, 2017_\n\nAnd there’s something even more interesting – organizations closely connected to hospitals,\nclinics and doctors, i.e. the pharmaceutical industry. Here we see even more attacks. The\npharmaceutical industry means “money”, so it’s another titbit for attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Attacks detected in pharmaceutical organizations, 2017_\n\nLet’s return to our patients. Where are all these attacked hospitals and clinics? Ok, here we\nthe numbers are relative: we divided the number of devices in medical organizations in the\ncountry with our AV by the number of devices where we detected malicious code. The TOP 3\nwere the Philippines, Venezuela and Thailand. Japan, Saudi Arabia and Mexico took the last\nthree spots in the TOP 15.\n\nSo the chances of being attacked really depend on how much money the government\nspends on cybersecurity in the public sector and the level of cybersecurity awareness.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Attacked devices in medical organizations, TOP 15 countries_\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry we have a completely different picture. First place belongs to\nBangladesh. I googled this topic and now the stats look absolutely ok to me. Bangladesh\nexports meds to Europe. In Morocco big pharma accounts for 14% of GDP. India, too, is in\nthe list, and even some European countries are featured.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Attacked devices in pharmaceutical organizations, TOP 15 countries_\n\nOn one in ten devices and in more than 25% of medical and 10% of pharmaceutical\ncompanies we detected hacktools: pentesting tools like Mimikatz, Meterpreter, tweaked\nremote administration kits, and so on.\n\nWhich means that either medical organizations are very mature in terms of cybersecurity and\nperform constant audits of their own infrastructure using red teams and professional\npentesters, or, more likely, their networks are infested with hackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hacktools: Powerpreter, Meterpreter, Remote admin, etc._\n\n### APT\n\nOur research showed that APT actors are interested in information from pharmaceutical\norganizations. We were able to identify victims in South East Asia, or more precisely, in\nVietnam and Bangladesh. The criminals had targeted servers and used the infamous PlugX\nmalware or Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data.\n\nPlugX RAT, used by Chinese-speaking APT actors, allows criminals to perform various\nmalicious operations on a system without the user’s knowledge or authorization, including\nbut not limited to copying and modifying files, logging keystrokes, stealing passwords and\ncapturing screenshots of user activity. PlugX, as well as Cobalt Strike, is used by\ncybercriminals to discreetly steal and collect sensitive or profitable information. During our\nresearch we were unable to track the initial attack vectors, but there are signs that they could\nbe attacks exploiting vulnerable software on servers.\n\nTaking into account the fact that hackers placed their implants on the servers of\npharmaceutical companies, we can assume they are after intellectual property or business\nplans.\n\n## How to live with it\n\n\n-----\n\nRemove all nodes that process medical data from public\nPeriodically update your installed software and remove unwanted applications\nRefrain from connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN of your organization\n\n[More tips at “Connected Medicine and Its Diagnosis“.](https://securelist.com/connected-medicine-and-its-diagnosis/81857/)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Infrastructure](https://securelist.com/tag/infrastructure/)\n[Internet of Things](https://securelist.com/tag/internet-of-things/)\n[Medical threats](https://securelist.com/tag/medical-threats/)\n[PlugX](https://securelist.com/tag/plugx/)\n[Security Policies](https://securelist.com/tag/security-policies-2/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Denis Makrushin](https://securelist.com/author/denisma/)\n\n[Yury Namestnikov](https://securelist.com/author/yurynamestnikov/)\n\nTime of death?
