Initially, it was\nfound to be distributed through exploit kits, and Threat Actors (TAs) utilized it to deploy other malware, such as the GrandCrab ransomware\nand the Flawed Ammyy Remote Access Trojan. In 2022, the Amadey bot was used by affiliates of LOCKBIT to spread ransomware to the\nvictims.\n\nRecently, Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has detected a significant increase in the number of Amadey bot samples, indicating\nthat threat actors are actively utilizing this bot to infect victims’ systems with additional malware. The statistics below depict the frequency of\nAmadey bot samples observed over Q4-2022.\n\nFigure 1 – Amadey bot\n\nstatistics\n\n\n-----\n\n## Initial Infection:\n\nRecently, the Amadey bot has been observed spreading through phishing sites, in addition to its usual method of being downloaded by the\nsmoke loader through spam emails. The phishing site mimics Game Cheat that downloads a “Bossmenu Setup.rar” file from the URL:\n\n_“hxxps[:]//valorantcheatsboss[.]com/upload/boss/Bossmenu%20Setup[.]rar”._\n\nUsers are shown the phishing site used by the TAs for spreading the Amadey bot when they click the download button, shown in the figure\nbelow.\n\nFigure 2 –\n\nPhishing website downloading Amadey bot\nThe downloaded .rar file contains a file named “Seil.exe” (sha256:\n_0f74d2fb5d1b603cdac4bf0179feba25ee0343f759b71404e5cd120e32a60517), which is responsible for downloading the Amadey bot from the_\nremote server.\n\n[The “Seil.exe” file is a .NET compiled file that downloads encrypted content from hxxp[:]//valorantcheatsboss[.]com/upload/bass/808, decrypts](http://valorantcheatsboss.com/upload/bass/808)\nit, and loads another DLL module as shown below.\n\nFigure 3 – Code snippet to download DLL Module\nThe DLL Module is protected by multiple layers, which finally loads the Amadey bot in the running process “Seil.exe”.\n\n## Amadey Bot Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\ne a e ta e t e be o sa p e as o a a ys s (S 56), b0030 c a3 d30e d6 99 5bce63 c be5e 5a 055e5 _d 9866e 8 8 96 b65,_\nwhich is a 32-bit VC++ compiled executable file, as shown below.\n\nFigure 4 – Static details of loader\n\nThe Amadey bot malware creates a copy of itself in a random directory located in the %Temp% location and executes it using the\n_ShellExecuteA() API._\n\n_C:\\Users\\[user-name]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\4b9a106e76\\nbveek.exe_\n\nAfter this, the Amadey bot creates a Mutex named “c1ec479e5342a25940592acf24703eb2” to ensure that only one instance of malware is\nrunning at any given time on the infected system.\n\n### Persistence\n\nThe malware establishes persistence by adding a “startup” value in the below registry key.\n\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders._\n\nThe registry value “Startup” contains the path of the Amadey bot that was dropped in the %temp% location. Using this technique, the Amadey\nbot executes whenever a user logs in.\n\nFigure 5 – Registry entry for persistence\nThe Amadey bot creates persistence by creating a Task Scheduler entry for the sample dropped in the %temp% location. The Task Scheduler\nconfigured by the malware is set to execute the malicious sample every minute, as shown below.\n\nFigure 6 – Task scheduler entry for persistence\nThe Amadey bot now gets the machine’s username and modifies the permission of the file “nbveek.exe” and folder “4b9a106e76” by granting\nthe user to read/write and execute files using the following command.\n\n_“/k echo Y|CACLS “nbveek.exe” /P “User Name:N”&&CACLS “nbveek.exe” /P “User Name:R” /E&&echo Y|CACLS “..\\4b9a106e76” /P_\n_“User Name:N”&&CACLS “..\\4b9a106e76” /P “User Name:R” /E&&Exit”_\n\nAfter gaining permission, the malware collects information from the victim’s machine and connects to its C&C server using a POST request, as\nshown below\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7\n\n– C&C communication\nThe POST request contains the following fields with the victim’s sensitive information, such as username, system name, etc.\n\n**Field** **Description**\n\nid Victims’ ID\n\nVs Bot Version Number\n\nSd Bot ID\n\nOs Operating system version\n\nbi System Architecture\n\nar Admin Privilege status\n\npc Victims PC Name\n\nUn Username\n\ndm Domain Name\n\nav Anti-virus name\n\nLv Unknown\n\nOg Unknown\n\nUpon connecting to a Command and Control (C&C) server, the Amadey bot downloads two DLL files, “cred64.dll” and “clip64.dll,” to the\n_%appdata% location and executes them using rundll32.exe. These files are a credential stealing module and a clipper module, respectively._\n\nThe below figure shows the C&C panel of the Amadey bot.\n\nFigure 8 – C&C panel of Amadey Bot\n\n## Stealer Module\n\nThe file “Cred64.dll” (SHA256:398235467c51419c4d2df6b9a0fad678730ae52b6db55d26e96f7ba70cae2dc3) is a 64-bit Microsoft Visual\nC/C++ DLL executable. The figure below shows the static details of the malicious binary file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Static details of the stealer\n\nmodule\nThe “Cred64.dll” module is designed to collect sensitive information from browser files, such as the “Local State” and “Login Data” files.\n\nThe “Local State” file is a configuration file that holds various settings and information associated with the browser, including user preferences,\nthe status of open tabs, and the location of the user’s profile folder, which contains information like browsing history, cache, bookmarks, and\nextensions.\n\nThe “Login Data” file contains the user’s saved login credentials, such as usernames and passwords of websites visited by the user. The\nfollowing table illustrates the web browsers and files targeted to collect victims’ sensitive information.\n\nChrome \\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Local State \\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nOrbitum \\Orbitum\\User Data\\Local State \\Orbitum\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nComodo Dragon \\Comodo\\Dragon\\User Data\\Local State \\Comodo\\Dragon\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nChedot \\Chedot\\User Data\\Local State \\Chedot\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nCentBrowser \\CentBrowser\\User Data\\Local State \\CentBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nOpera Software \\Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Local State \\Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Login Data\n\nMicrosoft Edge \\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Local State \\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nSputnikLab \\SputnikLab\\Sputnik\\User Data\\Local State \\SputnikLab\\Sputnik\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nChromium \\Chromium\\User Data\\Local State \\Chromium\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nVivaldi \\Vivaldi\\User Data\\Local State \\Vivaldi\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nCocCoc \\CocCoc\\Browser\\User Data\\Local State \\CocCoc\\Browser\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nThe below image shows the assembly code used by the Stealer to collect information from one of the targeted web browsers, “Orbitum”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n10 – Assembly Code used to collect data from browsers\nThen, the DLL module extracts information related to crypto wallets by querying and reading files from specific directories. The stealer targets\nthe following crypto wallets:\n\n_%appdata%\\Armory\\_\n_%appdata%\\Dogecoin\\_\n_%appdata%\\Exodus\\exodus.wallet\\_\n_%appdata%\\Electrum\\wallets_\n_%appdata%\\Litecoin\\wallets_\n_%appdata%\\DashCore\\wallets\\_\n_%appdata%\\Monero\\wallets\\_\n\nLet’s assume the malware cannot access files containing sensitive wallet information. In that event, it uses the Taskkill command to forcefully\nterminate the crypto wallet client process if it is currently running on the victim’s device using the below commands.\n\n_Taskkill /IM litecoin-qt.exe /F_\n_Taskkill /IM dash-qt.exe /F_\n_Taskkill /IM ArmoryQt.exe /F_\n\nThe below image shows the assembly code used by malware to collect information from one of the targeted crypto wallets “Litecoin”.\n\nFigure 11 – Assembly Code\n\nused to collect data from crypto wallet\nThe malicious DLL file continues to gather information by searching for specific applications such as FTP client software (WinSCP, FileZilla),\nTelegram, and Pidgin instant messenger on the victim’s device. It then steals important information from their configuration and session data\nfiles\n\n\n-----\n\na y, t e Stea e odu e co u cates t t e be o C&C se e U a d se ds t e sto e o at o to t e eat cto (s)\n\n_hxxp[:]//62[.]204[.]41[.]242/9vZbns/index[.]php_\n\n## Clipper Module:\n\nThe Clip64.dll (SHA256 : 45f90d58562a9ee67bd129e4bbd538969aabd476e558aa0ff0a9cbdfb7d43a2e) is a 32-bit VC++ compiled DLL file\nwhich has three export functions named:\n\n_??4CClipperDLL@@QAEAAV0@$$QAV0@@Z_\n_??4CClipperDLL@@QAEAAV0@ABV0@@Z_\n_Main_\n\nThe “Clip64.dll” is a Clipper module that intercepts cryptocurrency transactions by replacing a victim’s intended recipient with the attacker’s\nwallet address. It does this by monitoring the clipboard of the victim’s computer and swapping any copied cryptocurrency wallet addresses with\nthe TA’s address. This results in the victim unknowingly sending their funds to the attacker instead of the intended recipient.\n\nWhen the Clipper module runs, it retrieves the value stored in the clipboard of the victims by utilizing the GetClipBoardData() API function, as\nshown below.\n\nFigure 12 – GetClipBoardData() function\nThen, the malware checks the data in the clipboard to see if it contains a cryptocurrency wallet address by evaluating it based on certain\nconditions, such as the length and starting character of the string. If a wallet address is detected, the malware uses the OpenClipBoard(),\n_EmptyClipBoard(), and SetClipBoard() functions to replace the legitimate wallet address with the attacker’s address, as shown below._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 – Replacing Clipboard value with TA’s wallet address.\n\n**Cryptocurrencies** **TA’s Wallet Address**\n\nBitcoin (BTC) bc1qslzv7hczpsatc8lq285gy38r4af0c3alsc4m77\n\nEthereum (ETH) 0x89E34Ee2016a5E5a97b5E9598C251D2a2746Ba0D\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) DBjzffi3umhLQbUGLRoNQwZ4pjoKyNFahf\n\nLitecoin (LTC) LdYspWr6nkQ3ZNNTsmba77u4frHDhji1Nv\n\nMonero (XMR) 42zbZM5ozb4iDSN7hxNnQ1DSAvEmGY3z2KvAYmMxSJkUCc5bJyJ5hdkUu4324VJx8ACcDJJXg2NbRdWVcDyS87tyLikjVV\n\nCRIL also identified that the Amadey Bot is responsible for downloading various malware families, such as Redline, Manuscript,\nBrowserHijackers, etc., into the victim’s machine.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn recent years, the design and capabilities of bots have advanced significantly.\n\nA bot like Amadey is fully equipped with features such as system reconnaissance, information stealing, downloading & executing other\nmalware, data exfiltration, and even clipper functionalities in its latest version.\n\nThis allows Threat Actors to steal personal, financial, and login information stored in web browsers, which can then be used for various\nfraudulent activities.\n\nThis type of malware’s wide range of capabilities makes them a significant threat to a broad range of potential victims. Cyble Research and\nIntelligence Labs will continue monitoring the latest phishing or malware strains in the wild and update blogs with actionable intelligence to\nprotect users from such notorious attacks.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nThe initial infection may happen via phishing websites, so enterprises should use security products to detect phishing websites.\nAvoid downloading pirated software from Warez/Torrent websites. The “Hack Tool” present on sites such as YouTube, Torrent sites, etc.,\ncontains such malware.\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected devices.\nUse a reputed antivirus and internet security software package on your connected devices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.\nEducate employees on protecting themselves from threats like phishing/untrusted URLs.\nBlock URLs that could be used to spread the malware e g Torrent/Warez\n\n\n-----\n\no to t e beaco o t e et o e e to b oc data e t at o by a a e o s\nUsers should also carefully check their wallet addresses before making any cryptocurrency transaction to ensure there is no change\nwhen copying and pasting the actual wallet addresses.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n\nExecution [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/)\n\n[T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n[T1218](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011/)\n\n[T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)\n\n[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/)\n\nPersistence [T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/)\n\nDefense Evasion [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)\n\n[T1497](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)\n\nCredential Access [T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\n\n[T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)\n\n[T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001/)\n\n[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/)\n\nDiscovery [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082)\n\n[T1518](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518)\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)\n\n[T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)\n\nCollection [T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\n[T1213](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)\n\nCommand and Control [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)\n\n[T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095)\n\n\nUser Execution\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter\nRundll32\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation\n\nNative API\n\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\nScheduled Task/Job\n\nObfuscated Files or Information\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\nOS Credential Dumping\n\nCredentials in Registry\n\nCredentials In Files\n\nInput Capture\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\nSecurity Software Discovery\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\nAccount Discovery\n\nData from Local System\n\nData from Information Repositories\n\nApplication Layer Protocol\n\nNon-Application Layer Protocol\n\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nIndicators Indicator\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n0f74d2fb5d1b603cdac4bf0179feba25ee0343f759b71404e5cd120e32a60517 Sha256 Seil.exe\n\nb00302c7a37d30e1d649945bce637c2be5ef5a1055e572df9866ef8281964b65 Sha256 Amadey Bot\n\n398235467c51419c4d2df6b9a0fad678730ae52b6db55d26e96f7ba70cae2dc3 Sha256 Cred64.dll\n\n45f90d58562a9ee67bd129e4bbd538969aabd476e558aa0ff0a9cbdfb7d43a2e Sha256 Clip64.dll\n\nhxxps[:]//valorantcheatsboss[.]com/upload/boss/Bossmenu%20Setup[.]rar URL Download URL\n\nhxxp[:]//valorantcheatsboss[.]com/upload/bass/808 URL Download URL\n\nhxxp[:]//62[.]204[.]41[.]242/9vZbns/index[.]php URL C&C\n\n\n-----",
