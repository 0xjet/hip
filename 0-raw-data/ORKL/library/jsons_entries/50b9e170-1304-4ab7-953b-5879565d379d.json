    "plain_text": "# Uroburos - highly complex espionage software with Russian roots\n\n**[gdatasoftware.com/blog/2014/02/23968-uroburos-highly-complex-espionage-software-with-russian-roots](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2014/02/23968-uroburos-highly-complex-espionage-software-with-russian-roots)**\n\nG Data Security experts have analyzed a very complex and sophisticated piece of malware,\ndesigned to steal confidential data. G Data refers to it as Uroburos, in correspondence with a\nstring found in the malware's code and following an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or\ndragon eating its own tail.\n\nIn the course of today, this blog article is going to be updated. The G DATA SecurityLabs will\npublish a document with an in-depth analysis of the Uroburos malware!\n\n## What is Uroburos?\n\nUroburos is a rootkit, composed of two files, a driver and an encrypted virtual file system.\nThe rootkit is able to take control of an infected machine, execute arbitrary commands and\nhide system activities. It can steal information (most notably: files) and it is also able to\ncapture network traffic. Its modular structure allows extending it with new features easily,\nwhich makes it not only highly sophisticated but also highly flexible and dangerous.\nUroburos' driver part is extremely complex and is designed to be very discrete and very\ndifficult to identify.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical complexity suggests connections to intelligence agencies\n\nThe development of a framework like Uroburos is a huge investment. The development team\nbehind this malware obviously comprises highly skilled computer experts, as you can infer\nfrom the structure and the advanced design of the rootkit. We believe that the team behind\nUroburos has continued working on even more advanced variants, which are still to be\ndiscovered.\nUroburos is designed to work in peer-to-peer mode, meaning that infected machines\ncommunicate among each other, commanded by the remote attackers. By commanding one\ninfected machine that has Internet connection, the malware is able to infect further machines\nwithin the network, even the ones without Internet connection. It can spy on each and every\ninfected machine and manages to send the exfiltrated information back to the attackers, by\nrelaying this exfiltrated data through infected machines to one machine with Internet\nconnection. This malware behavior is typical for propagation in networks of huge companies\nor public authorities. The attackers expect that their target does have computers cut off from\nthe Internet and uses this technique as a kind of workaround to achieve their goal.\nUroburos supports 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows systems. Due to the complexity of\nthis malware and the supposed spying techniques used by it, we assume that this rootkit\ntargets governments, research institutes, or/and big companies.\n\n## Relation to Russian attack against U.S. suspected\n\nDue to many technical details (file name, encryption keys, behavior and more details\nmentioned in this report), we assume that the group behind Uroburos is the same group that\nperformed a cyberattack against the United States of America in 2008 with a malware called\nAgent.BTZ. Uroburos checks for the presence of Agent.BTZ and remains inactive if it is\ninstalled. It appears that the authors of Uroburos speak Russian (the language appears in a\nsample), which corroborates the relation to Agent.BTZ. Furthermore, according to public\nnewspaper articles, this fact, the usage of Russian, also applied for the authors of\nAgent.BTZ.\n\nAccording to all indications we gathered from the malware analyses and the research, we\nare sure of the fact that attacks carried out with Uroburos are not targeting John Doe but high\nprofile enterprises, nation states, intelligence agencies and similar targets.\n\n## Probably undiscovered for at least three years\n\nThe Uroburos rootkit is one of the most advanced rootkits we have ever analyzed in this\nenvironment. The oldest driver we identified was compiled in 2011, which means that the\ncampaign remained undiscovered for at least three years.\n\n## Infection vector still unknown\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the current stage of the investigations it is unknown how Uroburos initially infiltrates high\nprofile networks. Many infection vectors are conceivable. E.g. spear phishing, drive-byinfections, USB sticks, or social engineering attacks.\n\n\n-----",
