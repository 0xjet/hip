While not previously publicly documented, the variant has been in the wild since at least\n2014. There are three primary differences between it and older Bisonal malware including a different cipher and encryption for C2\ncommunication, and a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. To date, we have only collected\n14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching the\nMicrosoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the\ndecoy PDF file’s contents.\n\n[Attacks using Bisonal have been blogged about in the past. In 2013, both COSEINC and](https://camal.coseinc.com/publish/2013Bisonal.pdf) [FireEye revealed attacks using Bisonal against](https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/cle-t04_final_v1.pdf)\n[Japanese organizations . In October 2017, AhnLab published a report called “Operation Bitter Biscuit,” an attack campaign against South](http://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/Operation%20Bitter%20Biscuit)\nKorea, Japan, India and Russia using Bisonal and its successors, Bioazih and Dexbia. We believe it is likely these tools are being used by one\ngroup of attackers.\n\nThough Bisonal malware has been in the wild for at least seven years and frequently updated, the actors keep using same high-level\nplaybooks. Common features of attacks involving Bisonal include:\n\nUsually targeting organizations related to government, military or defense industries in South Korea, Russia, and Japan.\nIn some cases, the use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for C2 servers.\nThe use of a target or campaign code with its C2 to track victim or attack campaign connections.\nDisguising the Bisonal malware as a PDF, Microsoft Office Document or Excel file.\nThe use of a decoy file in addition to the malicious PE file\nIn some cases, code to handle Cyrillic characters on Russian-language operating systems.\n\nWe observed all these characteristics in the latest attacks against both Russia and South Korea.\n\n## Targeting Russia\n\nWhile investigating attack campaigns, Unit 42 discovered a targeted attack against at least one organization in Russia which provides\ncommunication security services and products. The targeted organization specialises in encryption and cryptographic services and develops a\nbroad number of secure communication products which also includes telecommunication systems and data protection facilities. Given the\nsensitivity of the products being developed by the target organization, it is not a surprise to see a targeted attack towards the organisation by a\nknown threat actor.\n\n[Figure 1 shows the spear-phishing email sent to the target organization. The email was spoofed to look like it was sent from Rostec, a Russian](http://rostec.ru/en/)\nstate corporation that promotes the development, production and export of high-tech industrial products. The contents of the email suggest it\n\n\n-----\n\nas se t o t e ega suppo t a d co po ate go e a ce depa t e t o ostec a d c udes p oject deta s a ed at p o g t e ous g\nconditions of defence industry workers. It is interesting to note there is a relationship between the target company and Rostec: the attackers\nmay be trying to exploit the relationship between Rostec and the target to add an additional air of legitimacy to the attack.\n\n_Figure 1. Spear-phishing email sent to the Russian company_\n\nBelow is the translation from Russian into English by Google Translate.\n\n_Subject:_\n\n_A comprehensive project to create housing and construction cooperatives for defence workers_\n\n_Body:_\n\n_Good afternoon, dear colleagues!_\n\n_By the May Day, I am sending you a comprehensive project aimed at improving the housing conditions of defence industry workers_\n\n_Congratulations!_\n\n_Attachment:_\n\n_Comprehensive project for the creation of housing construction cooperatives for defence workers .exe_\n\nAs you can see in Figure 1, some email clients do not display the attachment as the PDF. However, if you save the file on the computer, it\nlooks like a PDF document because the executable file has the PDF icon in the resource.\n\nOnce the malicious executable attachment is opened, the main payload is dropped in the victim machine and displays a decoy file to the\nvictim. Figure 2 shows the contents of the decoy file which is a PDF whose contents are an exact match to an article published on Rostec’s\nwebsite on January 30,th 2018. The article discusses new housing project plans by Rostec and other state departments, and the benefits to the\ndefence industry workers who are eligible for free housing under the project.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Decoy pdf file_\n\nUpon further analysis of the malware payload, we determined it is part of the Bisonal malware family. Since the details of the malware family\nhave already been published, we will discuss some of the unique indicators and techniques the threat actor behind Bisonal employed in this\ncampaign.\n\nMalware Analysis\n\n**Malware Dropper**\n\nThe dropper executable file in the Russian attack hides the encrypted Bisonal DLL file and non-malicious decoy file at the end of its body.\nOnce executed, the dropper decrypts the data blob using the RC4 cipher with the key, “34123412”, saves them in the path shown below and\nexecutes them.\n\n**Type** **PATH** **SHA256**\n\n\nDropper\nEXE\n\nBisonal\nDLL\n\nRussian\nDecoy\nPDF\n\n\nN/A b1da7e1963dc09c325ba3ea2442a54afea02929ec26477a1b120ae44368082f8\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\pvcu.dll 1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\Комплексный\nпроект по созданию жилищностроительных кооперативов для\nработников оборонки.pdf\n\n\nF431E0BED6B4B7FFEF5E40B1B4B7078F2538F2B2DB2869D831DE5D7DF26EE6CD\n\n\n_Table 1. File hashes and paths targeting Russia_\n\n\n-----\n\ne d oppe t e c eates o o g eg st y e t y to e ecute t e so a sa p e e t e co pute eboots\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\”vert” = “rundll32.exe c:\\windows\\temp\\pvcu.dll, Qszdez”\n\nBisonal main module\nThe DLL (pvcu.dll) is Bisonal malware but using a different cipher for C2 communication that other publicly documented samples. Booz Allen\n[Hamilton in 2014 and AhnLab in 2015 reported on Bisonal using a simple XOR cipher to hide the C2 address strings in the body. The Bisonal](http://asec.ahnlab.com/1026)\nsample we observed in this case employs the RC4 cipher with the key “78563412”. To date, all Bisonal samples we have seen using RC4 use\nthis same key. The oldest sample we have dates to 2014, so this variant has been in the wild for several years.\nAdding to the change in encryption type, a large part of the code such as network communication procedures, and the persistence method\nhave been re-written. For example, the Bisonal malware in 2012 used send() and recv() APIs to communicate with its C2. For this variant, the\ndeveloper wholly recreated C2 code from scratch by using other network APIs, such as HttpSendRequest() and InternetReadFile().\nThis Bisonal variant used in the latest attack communicates with one of the following hard-coded C2 addresses by using the HTTP POST\nmethod on TCP port 443.\n\nkted56erhg.dynssl[.]com\neuiro8966.organiccrap[.]com\n\nThese domains are provided by a free DDNS service and both resolve to the same IP address, 116.193.155[.]38.\nWhen this Bisonal variant communicates with its C2, the malware sends an HTTP POST request with the static strings “ks8d” and “akspbu.txt”,\nand the IP address of the compromised machine. Figure 3 shows the initial HTTP POST request to the C2 server.\n\n_Figure 3. Initial network C2 beacon_\n\nReaders may notice the missing closing parenthesis in the User Agent request header. That string is hardcoded in this malware variant. We\nhave more than 230 samples of Bisonal in total and only 14 samples since 2014 use this incomplete User Agent string. It is unclear whether\nthe author forgot to add closing parenthesis while developing the code, or intentionally use this string for validating the connection to the C2\nserver. Either way, it can be a good Indicator in network logs for a possible Bisonal infection.\n\nC2 Communication\n\nAnother sign of the infection is the data being sent to the C2 server during the initial connection. Every time this variant of Bisonal\ncommunicates with its C2, it sends a unique id number and backdoor command in the first eight bytes. The malware sends hardcoded\nDWORD values (0x10000 and 0x3E7) just for the initial connection and receives updated values from the C2 and uses them for further\ncommunication. As described above, all communications between this Bisonal variant and C2 are encrypted by RC4 cipher with the static key\n“78563412”. As the result of enciphering static values, the backdoor always sends identical eight bytes of data (81b2a8977ea31b91) to the C2\nfirst.\n\nSoon after receiving the initial beacon from the victim infected with Bisonal, the C2 replies with a session id number and backdoor command.\nThe session id number is consistent throughout the C2 communication. The malware then processes the given command on the compromised\nsystem and sends the result back to C2 with the session id number and the backdoor command number. Then the C2 replies with that same\nsession id number. The backdoor waits five seconds and restarts communication with the C2 with the same session id number.\n\n\n-----\n\ne o s a e a p e o t e ep y to t e co a d, get syste o e actua t a c bet ee t e C a d so a sa p e s o t e e t s de,\nand the decrypted payload is on the right side. The first DWORD (four bytes) is the given session id, 0x00000003, and the next DWORD is a\nbackdoor command, 0x000000C8. At offset 8 of the decrypted payload, there is a campaign or target code. In this sample, it is “0425god”.\n\n_Figure 4 Decrypted payload showing the target/campaign code_\n\nFollowing is the diagram of the session between Bisonal and C2.\n\n_Figure 5. Bisonal C2 communication flow_\n\nThe following table shows the list of backdoor commands this sample supports.\n\n**Command** **Meaning**\n\n0x000000C8 gets system info\n\n0x000000C9 gets running process list\n\n0x000000CA terminates process\n\n0x000000CB accesses cmd shell\n\n0x000000CD downloads file\n\n0x000000CF executes file\n\n0x000000D1 creates file\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 2 Backdoor commands_\n\nStrong Interests in Cyrillic\nPrevious reports have discussed Bisonal malware used in attacks against Japan, South Korea and Russia. This particular sample we found\ntargeted an organization in Russia and there is a specific system language check for Cyrillic and no others. When the backdoor receives the\nshell access command, it checks the code page of the compromised system. If it’s Cyrillic and the command to the shell is not ‘ipconfig’, the\nthreat converts the command result text encoding from Cyrillic to UTF-16. For any other code page the malware presumes the resulting text as\ndefault Windows ANSI code page and also converts it to UTF-16. It is not known why the malware author called out Cyrillic specifically when\nthe malware would convert any text to UTF-16. Windows ANSI code pages supports ASCII characters and non-ASCII values as the\ninternational characters depends on the OS language. UTF-16 can support maximum 1 million characters in Unicode. To avoid corrupting\nCyrillic (and other language) characters in the results, the developer added the code to the malware.\n\n_Figure 6. Checking of Cyrillic character set_\n\nThis Cyrillic/ipconfig checks in the ‘shell access’ backdoor command exists in some original Bisonal samples found in 2012. The sample\n(43459f5117bee7b49f2cee7ce934471e01fb2aa2856f230943460e14e19183a6) contains the marker string “bisonal” which is the origin of the\nmalware name. This is one of the many reasons we strongly believe the latest samples are variants of Bisonal.\n\n_Figure 7. 'bisonal' marker string_\n\nTargeting South Korea\n\nWhile investigating other Bisonal samples we found another dropper submitted to an online malware database on March 6. The original file\nname was “2018년 해양경찰청 공무원 (7급 9급) (2018.03.05).pdf.exe”. This translates to “2018 Korean Coast Guard Government Employee\n(Grade 7, Grade 9).pdf.exe” in English. Similar to the Bisonal variant targeting the Russian organization, this sample was also disguised as\nPDF document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Malware disguised as PDF_\n\nThe dropper executable installs Bisonal and a decoy file in the paths shown in Table 3, below.\n\n**Type** **PATH** **SHA256**\n\nDropper EXE N/A 0641fe04713fbdad272a6f8e9b44631b7554dfd1e1332a8afa767d845a90b3fa\n\nBisonal EXE %Temp%\\[random].tmp 359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC\n\n\nKorean Decoy\nPDF\n\n\n\n[dropper path]\\[same file name\nwithout .exe].pdf\n\n\nB2B764597D097FCB93C5B11CBD864AB1BCB894A2A1E2D2DE1C469880F612431C\n\n\n_Table 3, File hashes and system installation paths targeting South Korea_\n\nThough the functionality of the two dropper samples look very similar, the dropper code of this sample is completely different from the Russian\ntargeting sample described above.\n\nThe dropper installs the Bisonal EXE file and decoy PDF file. These files are not encrypted and the offset to the EXE and PDF file in the\ndropper is appended at the end of the dropper file. In the Russian samples, the offset to these files is hardcoded in the code.\nThe file name of the decoy file is based on the dropper file name. The dropper code creates a PDF at the same directory, give the same\nname with itself to the decoy file, removes .exe and adds .pdf in the code. For example, if the file name is ABCDEFG.pdf.exe, the decoy\nfilename would be pdf.pdf.\nThe dropper also creates two VBS scripts in the %Temp% directory with a random 4 digits hexadecimal name. One of them opens the\ndecoy PDF file. The other deletes the dropper and the VBS script itself.\n\nThe contents of the decoy PDF is a job descriptions with the South Korean Coast Guard. The original document was a Hangul Word\n[Processor(HWP) file posted on the South Korean Coast Guard website on March 5, 2018. Based on the metadata we found in the PDF, we](http://www.kcg.go.kr/kcg/news/recruit/?boardId=bbs_0000000000000095&mode=view&cntId=53&category=&pageIdx=2&searchCondition=all&searchKeyword=)\nstrongly believe that the attacker converted the HWP to PDF. Figure 8, below, shows metadata added to the decoy file when converting the\noriginal file to PDF. The metadata indicates that the file was created with Adobe Distiller 8.00 (Windows) on March 6 by “조영태” (Cho Young\nTae in English).\nInterestingly, the same creator name is found in the decoy PDF file of another sample of the Bisonal variant\n(dfa1ad6083aa06b82edfa672925bb78c16d4e8cb2510cbe18ea1cf598e7f2722) submitted to an online malware database in September 2014.\nThis decoy is a contact list of Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee of the National Assembly of the Republic of\nKorea. According to the metadata, this file is also converted from an HWP document with same tool by same creator. Though we don’t know\nwhether the creator is real or fake information, we can say the attacker has not changed this tool and technique for years.\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e 8_ _etadata_ _t e decoy_ _e_\n\nMain EXE\nThe installed EXE file is almost exactly the same as the DLL version of Bisonal variant used against the Russian organization. Following is a\nbrief write-up of the Bisonal EXE’s behavior. There are only three differences from the DLL sample; creating a registry entry by itself, the C2\ndomain and the target or campaign code. The EXE’s behavior is discussed below.\n\nIt creates the registry entry, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\”mismyou” = %Temp%\n\n[random].tmp to achieve persistence. In contrast, the DLL version does not create a registry entry because the dropper of the DLL does.\nIt decrypts the C2 domain address by using the RC4 cipher with the same key “78563412”.\nIt connects to hxxp://games.my-homeip[.]com:443/ks8d[ip address]akspbu.txt by using the HTTP POST method with the same\nincomplete User Agent string “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322”\nIt sends the same initial beacon value of 81b2a8977ea31b91 to the C2 server.\nIt uses a different target or campaign code, “pmo”.\nIt has same backdoor commands, starting with 0x000000C8 in hex.\nIt also checks the code page and command in “shell access” and converts text from Cyrillic to UTF-16.\n\nFollowing table is the summary of the Bisonal samples described in this article.\n\n\n**Year** **Target**\n**Country**\n\n\n**Campaign**\n**or Target**\n**Code**\n\n\n**SHA256** **Cipher** **Bisonal**\n**Marker**\n\n\n**Cy**\n**ip**\n**ch**\n\n\n2012 unidentified 1031 43459f5117bee7b49f2cee7ce934471e01fb2aa2856f230943460e14e19183a6 XOR YES YE\n\n\n2014 South\nKorea\n\n\n0919-1 dfa1ad6083aa06b82edfa672925bb78c16d4e8cb2510cbe18ea1cf598e7f2722 RC4 NO YE\n\n\n2018 Russia 0425god 1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75 RC4 NO YE\n\n\n2018 South\nKorea\n\n\npmo 359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC RC4 NO YE\n\n\n_Table 4 Summary of the Bisonal samples in this blog_\n\nConclusion\nThe attackers behind Bisonal have been active for at least 7 years, and the variant used against the Russian and South Korean targets\ndiscussed in this blog in the wild since 2014. Since the attackers frequently rewrite functions from scratch and avoid reusing infrastructures,\nsome samples look very different from original Bisonal malware. However, as we discussed in this blog, the same original piece of code\nreferencing the malware name \"bisonal\" remains in at least some samples.\nWe are still investigating the connection between the latest attacks discussed in this blog and the previous Bisonal attacks reported by industry\ncolleagues. The high-level TTPs of the adversary behind these Bisonal samples matches with previous Bisonal activity. The targets are military\nor defense industry in particular countries, it used DDNS for C2 servers, and tracked connections from their victims by using target or\ncampaign codes, as well as disguising the malware as document file, and using a dropper to install the malware and decoy file. We currently\nbelieve one group is behind these attacks, and we continue to investigate.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat by:\n\nWildFire detects all Bisonal files with malicious verdicts\n[AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the Bisonal tag](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Bisonal)\nTraps blocks all of the files associated with Bisonal\n\nIoC\nDropper SHA256:\nB1DA7E1963DC09C325BA3EA2442A54AFEA02929EC26477A1B120AE44368082F8\n0641FE04713FBDAD272A6F8E9B44631B7554DFD1E1332A8AFA767D845A90B3FA\n\n**Bisonal SHA256:**\n43459F5117BEE7B49F2CEE7CE934471E01FB2AA2856F230943460E14E19183A6\nDFA1AD6083AA06B82EDFA672925BB78C16D4E8CB2510CBE18EA1CF598E7F2722\n1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75\n359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC\n\n**C2:**\njennifer998.lookin[.]at\n196.44.49[.]154\nwww.hosting.tempors[.]com\nkted56erhg dynssl[ ]com\n\n\n-----\n\neu o8966 o ga cc ap[ ]co\n116.193.155[.]38\ngames.my-homeip[.]com\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
