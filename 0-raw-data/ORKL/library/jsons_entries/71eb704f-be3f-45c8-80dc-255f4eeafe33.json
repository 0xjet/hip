The attack aimed to infect them with Dridex. Dridex is a sophisticated\neBanking Trojan that emerged from the code base of Bugat / Cridex in 2014. Despite\n[takedown attempts by the security industry and several arrests conducted by the FBI in](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/pittsburgh/news/press-releases/bugat-botnet-administrator-arrested-and-malware-disabled)\n2015, the botnet is still very active. In 2016, MELANI / GovCERT.ch became aware of a\nhandful of highly sophisticated attacks against small and medium businesses (SMB) in\n[Switzerland aiming to steal large amounts of money by targeting offline payment software.](https://www.melani.admin.ch/melani/de/home/dokumentation/newsletter/offline-payment-software.html)\nDuring our incident response in 2016, we could identify Dridex to be the initial infection\nvector, which had arrived in the victim’s mailbox by malicious Office Word documents, and\nuncovered the installation of a sophisticated malware called Carbanak, used by the attacker\nfor lateral movement and conducting the actual fraud. Between 2013 and 2015, the\n[Carbanak malware was used to steal approximately 1 billion USD from banks worldwide.](https://blog.kaspersky.com/billion-dollar-apt-carbanak/7519/)\n\n## The Traditional Dridex Spam Runs\n\nDridex’s main infection vector is malspam. But unlike most of the spam that arrives at\ninternet users’ mailbox every day, spam mails distributing Dridex don’t originate from\ncompromised machines – so called spambots –, but rather from infrastructure rented by the\nattackers themselves for the exclusive purpose of sending out their malspam mails. As the\nIP addresses and domain names used to distribute Dridex are under control of the\nattackers, all state-of-the-art methods are available to ensure the infrastructure as well as\nthe distributed spam emails look legit and therefore bypass common spam filters. For\nexample, Dridex spam usually originates from IP space of hosting companies with a valid\nrDNS record which matches the sender’s domain name (from and envelope-from). In\naddition, the sending domain names all have a valid SPF record (Sender Policy\nFramework) matching the senders IP address. Nevertheless, spam filter- and DNSBL\nprovider did catch up in the recent weeks, doing a better job in detecting mails distributing\nDridex, marking them as spam. Therefore, we have seen less Dridex malspam emails being\ndelivered to the internet users’ mailboxes recently than we did before.\n\n## The Role of ESPs\n\nIn the past weeks, we could lean back a bit and watch common spam filters doing a good\njob identifying and blocking Dridex spam campaigns that are being sent to Swiss internet\nusers every Tuesday – Thursday. However, on Wednesdays February 15, 2017, the game\nchanged.\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after noon, we have seen a huge spike in emails being delivered to our spamtraps.\nThe emails looked like this:\n\n_Dridex spam mail sent to Swiss internet users on Feb 15, 2017 (click to enlarge)_\nA first glance at the sender email doesn’t reveal it as spam. Even looking at the email’s\nheader wrongly supports the same: The email has been sent out by SendGrid. SendGrid is\na well-known Email Service Provider (ESP) offering email marketing and transactional email\nservice. Many big companies and brands rely on ESPs to ensure that their emails are being\n\n\n-----\n\ndelivered to their customer s mailboxes smoothly. As many of the fortune 100 companies\nare using an ESP, IP addresses associated which such are often whitelisted at common\nemail servers and DNSBL providers. The reason for this is simple: You can’t blacklist an IP\naddress associated with an ESP as much as you can’t blacklist IP addresses associated\nwith Google or Outlook.com. Otherwise you might end up blocking thousands of legitimate\nemails coming from Uber, Spotify, Airbnb and any other brands that are using the ESP’s\ninfrastructure to send emails.\n\n_[SendGrid Service description highlighting by the vendor (source: SendGrid)](https://www.sendgrid.com/)_\n\n## The Spam Email\n\nThe emails we have seen hitting our traps on February 15, 2017 pretended to come from\nSwisscom. Swisscom is Switzerland’s biggest telecommunication provider. It is a brand that\nis known to every Swiss citizen. The mails claim to be an e-bill (Rechnung), which isn’t\nuncommon as Swisscom is indeed sending out e-bills via email. But why would Swisscom\nsend an e-bill to our spam traps? And why not just one, but rather thousands within just a\ncouple of minutes? This made us suspicious, so we decided to take a closer look at these\nemails. The attackers have prepared the spam emails very well. Below is a screenshot of a\nlegit e-bill that Swisscom usually sends out to their customers, and the fake one spammed\nout by the offenders:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fake Swisscom e-bill compared to a real one (click to enlarge)_\nThe emails look very similar, but they aren’t identical. The reason for this is simple: The\nspam email on the left side pretends to be an e-bill from Swisscom to an enterprise\ncustomer (SME), while the one on the right side is a legit e-bill sent out by Swisscom to a\nhome user (SOHO), because we don’t have a legitimate SME type e-bill available. The left\n(fake) one pretends to come from sme.contactcenter@bill.swisscom.com, while the right,\nlegit one has been sent from contact.center@bill.swisscom.com. As the spam emails are\napparently targeting enterprise customers (SME), the invoice total is much higher than what\na home user expects to be billed.\n\nLooking at one of these emails for a second time, it appears that the the diacritical\ncharacters ä/ö/ü, which are very common in German, are completely missing and replaced\nby a/o/u. Secondly, the hyperlink “Rechnung einsehen” that the user should click (which\nmeans “review bill”) does not point to a domain name owned by Swisscom, but to\nMicrosoft’s Sharepoint service. Analyzing all of such emails we got, we were able to collect\nthe following URLs:\n```\nhttps://jensenbowersmy.sharepoint.com/personal/leeanderson_jensenbowers_com_au/_layouts/15/download.aspx?\ndocid=068187f5a930340c89e3b7c5c9b9c24f7&authkey=AarHUbAy66DSX08VzRPQ25w\nhttps://talofinancialmy.sharepoint.com/personal/ashleigh_schipp_talofinancial_com_au/_layouts/15/guestacce\ndocid=07697c8afb3e544808bf527394eb7154b&authkey=Adh6QVItbnSLOpXvxh_BfCs\nhttps://yemposolutions-my.sharepoint.com/personal/amor_novicio_yempo-solutions_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?\ndocid=0ce03b9fd12d949cf91f56a7d1fbf4b93&authkey=ASOCPusN_QaBSXcCPxEkT9s\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFollowing these links reveal them to serve a ZIP archive called Rechnung.zip containing a\nJavaScript file with the matching name Rechnung.js. So, is Swisscom sending out\nJavaScript files to their customers? Not really – we became suspicious.\n\n## The JavaScript\n\nHaving a look at the JavaScript confirms our suspicion that these emails can’t be legit: The\nJavaScript files are highly obfuscated:\n\n_Obfuscated JavaScript (click to enlarge)_\nAfter deobfuscation, the purpose of the script becomes clear:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Deobfuscated JavaScript (click to enlarge)_\nOnce executed, the script will download a windows binary from Sharepoint online and\nexecute it:\n```\nhttps://talofinancialmy.sharepoint[.]com/personal/ashleigh_schipp_talofinancial_com_au/_layouts/15/guestac\ndocid=07697c8afb3e544808bf527394eb7154b&authkey=Adh6QVItbnSLOpXvxh_BfCs\nhttps://yemposolutions-my.sharepoint.com/personal/amor_novicio_yempo-solutions_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?\ndocid=0ce03b9fd12d949cf91f56a7d1fbf4b93&authkey=ASOCPusN_QaBSXcCPxEkT9s\n\n## The Payload\n\n```\nThe JavaScript drops the following windows executable from the said Sharepoint URLs:\n```\nFilename: line.registr\nMD5 hash: 20e10d0c6828e6df0882c043113285d6\nSHA256 hash: e01c0ba8b8e3ad5735bdd15bda5bf449ec9c6167badd7173fca04eb6b41570e2\n\n```\nDoing a quick analysis of the payload reveals the distributed malware as Dridex (version\n4.23).\n\nDridex is using different botnets (botnetid). Each botnet has its own configuration file and is\ntargeting a specific country or a set of countries. The Dridex payload we have observed in\nthis campaign could be associated with botnetid 2144, which is known for attacking\ncustomers of financial institutions in Switzerland.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce executed, an infected computer is going to call out to six different IP address that all\nact as botnet command&control server (C&C) for the Dridex malware. Each of these IP\naddresses belongs to a compromised server in the internet and is forwarding the botnet\ntraffic from Dridex infected machines to a tier-2 infrastructure:\n```\n198.167.136.139:443\n159.226.92.9:4431\n136.243.209.34:443\n109.235.76.95:1843\n209.20.67.87:5353\n194.150.118.25:3101\n\n```\nA Dridex bot will contact any of these IP address and will try to get an updated configuration\nfrom the botnet masters. An updated configuration file will contain a new set of botnet\ncontrollers, a list of financial institutions in Switzerland for which Dridex redirects the traffic\n(online fraud), as well as a list of offline payment software (offline fraud).\n\nDridex also sends out a list of installed software to the botnet C&C. If that list includes\noffline payment software or software that could potentially be used to transfer payment\ninstructions (such as FTP clients), the infected machine (bot) will get flagged and the C&C\nmight deliver Carbanak. Otherwise, a full-featured version of Dridex is installed.\n\nThe Dridex configuration files we received can be downloaded at the links below:\n\n[Dridex configuration file](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/downloads/dridex_ini_20170220.json)\n[Dridex webinjects](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/downloads/dridex_config_20170220.json)\n\n## Summary of Infection Chain\n\nThe following graphic summarizes the events that lead up to the infection with Dridex and/or\nCarbanak:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Dridex / Carbanak infection chain (click to enlarge)_\n\n## Detection of Dridex\n\nDridex infections are hard to detect and to clean, as the malware usually only resides in\nmemory. Dridex is only written to disk upon shutdown, which it knows about from hooking\nWindow’s shutdown API calls. We learned about several cases where Dridex infections\nwere allegedly cleaned up by professional IT services, because they did not find traces of\nDridex on disk or startup entries related to Dridex. We recommend that infected systems\nare reimaged (reinstalled), or at least cleaned after booting from a rescue stick.\n\n\n-----\n\nA promising way to detect current or former infections of Dridex is to look at the registry.\nDridex stores its configuration in multiple registry keys of the format:\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\CLSID\\\n{GUID}\\ShellFolder\n\n```\n_{GUID} is the textual representation of an id that varies between infected clients. The data is_\nstored as binary data under a name which is also formatted like a GUID. The following\nscreenshot shows the registry for an infected system:\n\n_Screenshot of the Registry on a Dridex infected computer (click to enlarge)_\nA clean system, on the other hand, has fewer (usually one or two) entries that match the\npattern. None of the keys should have a GUID-like name or contain binary data:\n\n_Screenshot of the Registry on a clean computer (click to enlarge)_\n[We wrote a small Powershell-Script (dridexregistry.ps1) that checks the registry for potential](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/downloads/dridexregistry.zip)\nDridex entries. The script also checks the Appdata/Local and Appdata/LocalLow for binaries\nthat match the pattern of Dridex. As clarified above, these files do not usually exist even on\ninfected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nFilename: carbanaktargets.ps1\nMD5 hash: 04a98c92a8b943ee90b6bda921abe0f0\nSHA256: a2b667ccb014ba732e1ad337a582f8aa464b5fa7913ebd8034fe8b6bc6d6009a\nFilename: dridexregistry.ps1\nMD5 hash: d155bf49b289f14047b97b16d9a2a207\nSHA256: 8cdcad2546fd943fabe2e98de33f69ae6e8ea08eca5b5dadfc5f1a7cc90c3c1a\n\n```\nThe script exports the registry key. You may send these exports along to incident response\nor law enforcement agencies. On an infected system, the output of the script might look as\nfollows:\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\victim> dridexregistry.ps1\n!!! Host is was/is almost certainly infected by Dridex\nThere are 14 config folders, of which 4 are filled.\nWritten hkcu:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\CLSID to\nC:\\Users\\victim\\_out\\registry.reg\nFound no Dridex binaries\nWritten Report to C:\\Users\\victim\\_out\n\n```\n[We also wrote a PowerShell script (carbanaktargets.ps1) that compares the list of installed](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/downloads/carbanaktargets.zip)\napplications against the 360 products that Dridex looks for to determine if it wants to deliver\nCarbanak:\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\victim> carbanaktargets.ps1\nYour system has 'CuteFTP 9' installed, which could trigger Carbanak\nYour system has 'SeaMonkey 2.46 (x86 en-US)' installed, which could trigger Carbanak\nYour system has 'StarMoney' installed, which could trigger Carbanak\nYour system has 'StarMoney 9.0 ' installed, which could trigger Carbanak\nYour system could be the target of Carbanak\n\n```\nDisclaimer: The PowerShell scripts are provided with no guarantee and on best-effort.\nMELANI / GovCERT.ch can not be held liable for damages caused by the PowerShell script,\nfalse positives or false negatives.\n\n## Doing Incident Response\n\nAs a first reaction to the massive spam campaign, we have contacted SendGrid, kindly\nasking them to stop the associated email campaign. In addition, we have asked them to\nexplain to us from whom they received the authorization to send on behalf of\nswisscom.com. We were very surprised not to receive any response from SendGrid for 24\nhours. We therefore tried to reach them via a phone call (land line), but this turned out to be\na dead end too (“you have reached us outside business ours”). Another 24 hours passed\n[without any response from SendGrid, so we decided to reach out to them via Twitter. On](https://twitter.com/GovCERT_CH/status/832151096676204544)\nTwitter, we finally managed to get a life sign from SendGrid. Unfortunately, it appears that\nSendGrid was having trouble to locate our abuse report.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Twitter conversation we had with SendGrid (click to enlarge)_\nFive more days passed since we have sent our initial abuse report to SendGrid. As of today,\nwe are still waiting for official feedback from SendGrid.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDridex is a sophisticated threat. While it has been around for more than two years, the\ndetection rate by antivirus software is still quite low compared to other threats. The reason\nfor this can be found in the local distribution of the malware – in our case, the focus was on\nSwiss internet users – and its absence on disk while the computer is running (file-less):\nDridex operates exclusively in the memory when the computer is running. So there is no\nway for Antivirus programs to detect Dridex on disk.\n\nWe have also learned that Email Services Providers (ESPs) are representing an emerging\nrisk: Many postmasters, spam filter vendors and DNSBL providers trust email traffic coming\nfrom ESPs, by either completely whitelisting them, or a applying a significant negative score\n(which reduces the chances that an email from an ESP is being classified as spam). Botnet\noperators know this and are abusing ESP’s infrastructure to send their malspam\ncampaigns. This way, miscreants are able to bypass common spam filters and deliver their\nspam email directly to the victim’s mailbox. The following chart shows the success of\nabusing an ESP’s infrastructure by the fraudsters.\n\nThe chart below shows the number of user submissions on our phishing reporting platform\n[antiphishing.ch over the past two months:](https://www.antiphishing.ch/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of submissions to antiphishing.ch (click to enlarge)_\nOn Feb 15, 2017, we have received over 8 times more submissions from users than we\nusually did on average days. This impressively documents how efficient the use of\nSendGrid was for the miscreants to send out their emails. We believe that almost all emails\npassed spam filters and made it into the recipient’s inbox, resulting in a high infection rate\nwith Dridex across the Swiss internet.\n\nWe believe that it is an ESP’s duty to detect and block such malspam campaigns on their\ninfrastructure in a timely manner. We therefore recommend to postmasters, spam filter\nvendors and DNSBL providers to review their position with regards to ESPs, reevaluating\ntheir assessment and take action against ESPs failing to mitigate abuse from their service\nin time and/or ignoring abuse reports from 3rd parties.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nDridex might be more sophisticated than average malware. However, there are still a few\nthings you can do to protect yourself.\n\nIn general:\n\nYou can spot many of these spam mails by simply watching out for Umlauts (äöü). If\nyou receive an email that pretends to be from your bank or telecom provider and that\ncontains no Umlauts, but rather the plain letters (aou), you should be careful.\nSome of the spam mails contain ß instead of ss. Please consider that it is very\nunlikely that a native Swiss German speaker is using ß.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you are unsure whether the email you have received is legit or not, call the sender\nor contact him via email to verify the purpose of the email.\nNever execute macros in office documents you have received via email, even when\nthe sender asks you to do so. Macros may harm your computer!\nUse a dedicated computer for ebanking (no matter if you use traditional online\nbanking or an offline payment solution) and do nothing else than ebanking on this\ncomputer.\n\nFor private users:\n\nAlways keep your Antivirus software up to date. If you use a non-free Antivirus, make\nsure that your Antivirus is licensed and if not, renew it or switch to a free Antivirus\nsoftware to receive full protection. Otherwise the virus protection will expire and will no\nlonger protect you against new threats.\nDon’t rely on your Antivirus software alone – while it is indispensable, Antivirus can’t\nprotect you from everything and does not free you from being careful.\nRegularly make a backup of your data. The backup should be stored offline, i.e. on an\nexternal medium, such as an external hard disk. Make sure that the medium, where\nthe backup is saved onto, is disconnected from the computer after the backup\nprocedure is complete. Regularly test your backups.\n\nFor enterprises:\n\nFor payments or wire transfer issued via ebanking, make use of collective contracts.\nBy using collective contracts, every wire transfer needs to be signed and\nauthenticated by a second ebanking contract / login. Ask your bank about the use of\ncollective ebanking contracts.\nIf you use a hardware token (e.g. SmartCard, USB-Dongle) for authentication or\ntransaction signing, remove it from your device while you are not doing ebanking /\npayments.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlock the acceptance of dangerous email attachments on your email gateway. These\ninclude among others:\n\n.js (JavaScript)\n.jar (Java)\n.bat (batch file)\n.exe (Windows executable)\n.cpl (Control Panel)\n.scr (screen saver)\n.com (COM file)\n.pif (program information file)\n.vbs (Visual Basic Script)\n.ps1 (Windows PowerShell)\n.wsf (Windows Script File)\n.docm (Microsoft Word with macros)\n.xlsm (Microsoft Excel with macros)\n.pptm (Microsoft PowerPoint with macros)\nIn addition, all email attachments containing macros (e.g. Word, Excel or PowerPoint\nattachments) should be blocked on the email gateway as well.\nMake sure that such dangerous email attachments are also blocked if they are sent to\nrecipients in your company in archive files such as ZIP, RAR or even in encrypted\narchive files (e.g. by blocking password-protected ZIP files completely)\nYou can obtain additional protection against malware for your IT infrastructure by\nusing the [Windows AppLocker. This tool allows you to specify which programs are](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd759117(v=ws.11).aspx)\nallowed to be run on the computers in your company\nBlock the download of archives (such as ZIP or RAR) that contain JavaScript code on\nyour web gateway (Web-Proxy)\nEvaluate the SPF record (Sender Policy Framework http://www.openspf.org/) for\ndomain names that intend to send emails to your users. Reject emails whose sender\nIP address does not match the sending domains SPF record (inbound mail)\nImplement an SPF record for your own domain name(s) to prevent miscreants from\nspoofing emails pretending to come from your domain (outbound mail)\n[Use DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain-based Message](http://www.dkim.org/)\nAuthentication, Reporting & Conformance) for in-bound spam filtering (inbound mail)\nSign outgoing emails from your network to the internet with DKIM and DMARC (outbound mail)\n\nFurther information and mitigation strategies can be found on our website.\n\n**Checklist on IT security for SMEs:**\nhttps://www.melani.admin.ch/melani/en/home/dokumentation/checklists-andinstructions/merkblatt-it-sicherheit-fuer-kmus.html\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\nBelow is a list of indicators of compromise (IOC) that may help you to spot Dridex infected\ncomputers in your network.
