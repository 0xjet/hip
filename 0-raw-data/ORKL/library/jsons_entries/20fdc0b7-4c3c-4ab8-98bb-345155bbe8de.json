Wekby is a group that has been active for a number of years, targeting\nvarious industries such as healthcare, telecommunications, aerospace, defense, and high\ntech. The group is known to leverage recently released exploits very shortly after those\n[exploits are available, such as in the case of HackingTeam’s Flash zero-day exploit.](http://www.volexity.com/blog/?p=158)\n\n[The malware used by the Wekby group has ties to the HTTPBrowser malware family, and](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/chinese-cyber-espionage-apt-group-leveraging-recently-leaked-hacking-team-exploits-target-financial-services-firm)\nuses DNS requests as a command and control mechanism. Additionally, it uses various\nobfuscation techniques to thwart researchers during analysis. Based on metadata seen in\nthe discussed samples, Palo Alto Networks has named this malware family ‘pisloader’.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe pisloader malware family was delivered via HTTP from the following URL. At the time of\nwriting, this URL was still active.\n\n_http://globalprint-us[.]com/proxy_plugin.exe_\n\nOther samples hosted on this domain include the following:\n\n_http://globalprint-us[.]com/proxy_web_plugin.exe_\n\n**MD5: E4968C8060EA017B5E5756C16B80B012**\n\n**SHA256:**\n8FFBB7A80EFA9EE79E996ABDE7A95CF8DC6F9A41F9026672A8DBD95539FEA82A\n\n\n-----\n\n**Size: 126976 Bytes**\n**Compile Time: 2016-04-28 00:38:46 UTC**\n\nThis discovered file was found to be an instance of the common Poison Ivy malware family\nwith the following configuration data:\n\n**Command and Control Address: intranetwabcam[.]com**\n**Command and Control Port: 80**\n**Password: admin**\n**Mutex: )!VoqA.I5**\n\nThe domains witnessed in this attack were all registered very shortly prior to being used. The\nfollowing domains have been witnessed in this attack:\n\nAdditionally, the following IP resolutions have been observed.\n\n## Initial Dropper\n\nThe following sample was discovered initially and is referenced in the subsequent analysis:\n\n**MD5: E8D58AA76DD97536AC225949A2767E05**\n\n**SHA256:**\nDA3261C332E72E4C1641CA0DE439AF280E064B224D950817A11922A8078B11F1\n\n**Size: 126976 Bytes**\n\n**Compile Time: 2016-04-27 14:37:34 UTC**\n\nThis particular file has the following metadata properties. The references to ‘pisload2’ led to\nthe naming of this malware family.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 pisloader dropper metadata_\n\nThe initial dropper contains very simple code that is responsible for setting persistence via\nthe Run registry key, and dropping and executing an embedded Windows executable.\nLimited obfuscation was encountered, where the authors split up strings into smaller substrings and used ‘strcpy’ and ‘strcat’ calls to re-build them prior to use. They also used this\nsame technique to generate garbage strings that are never used. This is likely to deter\ndetection and analysis of the sample. The following decompiled code demonstrates this.\nComments have been added to show the fully-generated strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 pisloader dropper building strings and setting persistence_\n\nIn the above decompiled code, we see that the pisloader is generating the following string,\nwhich eventually is called to set the Run registry key.\n\n_cmd.exe /c reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v lsm /t reg_sz_\n_/d \"%appdata%\\lsm.exe\" /f_\n\nThis particular command will set the\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\lsm registry key with a value of\n“%appdata%\\lsm.exe”. After this key is set, the malware proceeds to decrypt a two blobs of\ndata with a single-byte XOR key of 0x54. The resulting data is written to the\n%appdata%\\lsm.exe file path.\n\nAfter this file is written, the malware executes the newly written lsm.exe file, which contains\nthe pisloader payload.\n\n## Payload\n\nThe following sample was discovered and is referenced in the subsequent analysis:\n\n**MD5: 07B9B62FB3B1C068837C188FEFBD5DE9**\n\n**SHA256:**\n456FFFC256422AD667CA023D694494881BAED1496A3067485D56ECC8FEFBFAEB\n\n**Size: 102400 Bytes**\n\n**Compile Timestamp: 2016-04-27 13:39:02 UTC**\n\nThe payload is heavily obfuscated using a return-oriented programming (ROP) technique, as\nwell as a number of garbage assembly instructions. In the example below, code highlighted\nin red essentially serves no purpose other than to deter reverse-engineering of the sample.\nThis code can be treated as garbage and ignored. The entirety of the function is highlighted\nin green, where two function offsets are pushed to the stack, followed by a return instruction.\nThis return instruction will point code execution first at the null function, which in turn will\npoint code execution to the ‘next_function’. This technique is used throughout the runtime of\nthe payload, making static analysis difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Obfuscated code witnessed in pisloader_\n\nThe malware is actually quite simplistic once the obfuscation and garbage code is ignored. It\nwill begin by generating a random 10-byte alpha-numeric header. The remaining data is\nbase32-encoded, with padding removed. This data will be used to populate a subdomain that\n\n\n-----\n\nwill be used in a subsequent DNS request for a TXT record.\n\nThe use of DNS as a C2 protocol has historically not been widely adopted by malware\nauthors. Notable exceptions include the following:\n\n[FrameworkPOS](https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/2014/10/23942-new-frameworkpos-variant-exfiltrates-data-via-dns-requests)\n[C3PRO-RACCOON](https://www.forcepoint.com/sites/default/files/resources/files/report_jaku_analysis_of_botnet_campaign_en_0.pdf)\n[FeederBot](http://blog.cj2s.de/archives/28-Feederbot-a-bot-using-DNS-as-carrier-for-its-CC.html)\n[Morto](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/morto-worm-sets-dns-record)\n[PlugX Variants](http://blog.airbuscybersecurity.com/post/2014/01/PlugX-v2%3A-meet-SController)\n\nThe use of DNS as a C2 allows pisloader to bypass certain security products that may not be\ninspecting this traffic correctly.\n\n_Figure 4 DNS query for TXT record by malware_\n\nThe pisloader sample will send a beacon periodically that is composed of a random 4-byte\nuppercase string that is used as the payload. An example of this can be found below:\n\n_Figure 5 pisloader DNS beacon request_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware expects various aspects of the DNS responses to be set in a specific way, or\nelse pisloader will ignore the DNS reply. The following DNS flags must be set. Should any\nadditional flags be set, the response will be ignored.\n\nResponse\nRecursion Desired\nRecursion Available\n\nThe ‘Questions’ field must be set to a value of 0x1. The ‘Answer Resource Records’ field\nmust be set to a value of 0x1. Additionally, the response query subdomain must match the\noriginal DNS request.\n\nThe remote command and control (C2) server is statically embedded within the malware. A\nsingle host of ‘ns1.logitech-usa[.]com’ is found in this specific sample.\n\nThe C2 server will respond with a TXT record that is encoded similar to the initial request. In\nthe response, the first byte is ignored, and the remaining data is base32-encoded. An\nexample of this can be found below.\n\n_Figure 6 Example TXT response by C2 server_\n\nThe following commands, and their descriptions are supported by the malware:\n\nsifo – Collect victim system information\ndrive – List drives on victim machine\nlist – List file information for provided directory\nupload – Upload a file to the victim machine\nopen – Spawn a command shell\n\nSome examples of these commands being used can be seen below. A mock DNS server\nwas used to generate the commands and receive the resulting data.\n\n**Example sending the ‘drive’ command:**\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n[+] Sending Command: drive | Encoded: CMRZGS5TF\n\n[+] Raw Data Received: UMAVMGAGD0IE5FY7CDHJOHYRB2LR6A\n\n[+] Decoded Data Received: A:\\|C:\\|D:\\|\n\n\n**Example sending the ‘open’ command:**\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n\n[+] Sending Command: open | Encoded: CN5YGK3Q\n\n[+] Raw Data Received:\nULCBMGAGCAJVUWG4TPONXWM5BAK5UW4ZDPO5ZSAW2WMVZHG2LP\n\n[+] Raw Data Received:\nATABMGAGCBNYQDMLRRFY3TMMBRLUGQUQ3POB4XE2LHNB2CAKDD\n\n[+] Raw Data Received:\nHTPDMGAGCCFEQDEMBQHEQE22LDOJXXG33GOQQEG33SOBXXEYLU\n\n[+] Raw Data Received:\nBNJWMGAGCDNFXW4LRAEBAWY3BAOJUWO2DUOMQHEZLTMVZHMZLE\n\n[+] Raw Data Received:\nUARCMGAGCEFYGQUDIKIM5FYVLTMVZHGXCKN5ZWQICHOJ2W46TX\n\n[+] Raw Data Received: UJRAMGAGC0MVUWOXCEMVZWW5DPOA7A\n\n[+] Decoded Data Received: Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.

This is\nconsistent with previous versions of HTTPBrowser, which is another malware family\nfrequently used by the Wekby group.\n\nAdditionally, a number of commands themselves, such as the ‘list’, ‘drive’, and ‘upload’\ncommands are consistent with HTTPBrowser. The formatted responses from these\n[commands are also identical. A known HTTPBrowser sample was spotted with similar](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/9995fe6ff112efb6de6498ace23f42b8d3689f3c890959728cbc888462b9ea0d/analysis/)\nmetadata as the discussed pisloader sample, which adds further credibility that pisloader is\nlikely a variant of this malware family.\n\n[Additionally, the code used to generate these commands is available via GitHub.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/public_tools/tree/master/pisloader/wekby_dns.py)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Wekby group continues to target various high profile organizations using sophisticated\nmalware. The pisloader malware family uses various novel techniques, such as using DNS\nas a C2 protocol, as well as making use of return-oriented programming and other antianalysis tactics.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\n\n\n-----\n\nWildFire correctly identifies all pisloader samples as malicious\nA [pisloader AutoFocus tag has been created in order to track this malware family](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Pisloader)\nAll domains/IPs used in this attack have been flagged as malicious.\nAn IPS rule has been created to detect pisloader DNS traffic\n\n## Appendix\n\n**External Resources**\n\n**SHA256 Hashes**\n\nda3261c332e72e4c1641ca0de439af280e064b224d950817a11922a8078b11f1\n\n930772d6af8f43f62ea78092914fa8d6b03e8e3360dd4678eec1a3dda17206ed\n\n6852ba95720af64809995e04f4818517ca1bd650bc42ea86d9adfdb018d6b274\n9200f80c08b21ebae065141f0367f9c88f8fed896b0b4af9ec30fc98c606129b\n\n4d62caef1ca8f4f9aead7823c95228a52852a1145ca6aaa58ad8493e042aed16\n\n1b341dab023de64598d80456349db146aafe9b9e2ec24490c7d0ac881cecc094\n\n456fffc256422ad667ca023d694494881baed1496a3067485d56ecc8fefbfaeb\n\n**Domains**\n\nns1.logitech-usa[.]com\n\nglobalprint-us[.]com\n\nintranetwabcam[.]com\n\nlogin.access-mail[.]com\n\nglb.it-desktop[.]com\n\nlocal.it-desktop[.]com\n\nhi.getgo2[.]com\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
