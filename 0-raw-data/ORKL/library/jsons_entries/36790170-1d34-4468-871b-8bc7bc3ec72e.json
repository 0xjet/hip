We named the actor DustSquad\nand have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns\ninvolving custom Android and Windows malware. In this blogpost we cover a malicious\nprogram for Windows called Octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities.\n\nThe name was originally coined by ESET in 2017 after the 0ct0pus3.php script used by the\nactor on their old C2 servers. We also started monitoring the malware and, using Kaspersky\nAttribution Engine based on similarity algorithms, discovered that Octopus is related to\n\n\n-----\n\nDustSquad, something we reported in April 2018. In our telemetry we tracked this campaign\nback to 2014 in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia (still mostly Russian-speaking),\nplus Afghanistan.\n\nIn the case of Octopus, DustSquad used Delphi as their programming language of choice,\nwhich is unusual for such an actor. Among others exceptions are the Russian-language\nZebrocy (Sofacy’s Delphi malware), the Hindi-language DroppingElephant and the Turkishlanguage StrongPity. Although we detected Octopus victims that were also infected with\nZebrocy/Sofacy, we didn’t find any strong similarities and we don’t consider the two actors to\nbe related.\n\n## What happened?\n\nIn April 2018 we discovered a new Octopus sample pretending to be Telegram Messenger\nwith a Russian interface. We couldn´t find any legitimate software that this malware appears\nto be impersonating; in fact, we don´t believe it exists. The Trojan uses third-party Delphi\nlibraries like The Indy Project for JSON-based C2 communications and TurboPower\nAbbrevia (sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia) for compression. Malware persistence is\nbasic and achieved via the system registry. The server side uses commercial hosting in\ndifferent countries with .php scripts deployed. Kaspersky Lab products detect the Octopus\nTrojan as Trojan.Win32.Octopus.gen. For more information, please contact:\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Technical details\n\nThe attackers used the potential Telegram ban in Kazakhstan to push its dropper as an\nalternative communication software for the political opposition.\n\n\n-----\n\n_‘Telegram messenger’ establishes network module persistence in the simplest way and starts the_\n\n_module_\n\nWe can’t confirm how this malware is being distributed, although it clearly uses some form of\nsocial engineering. This actor previously used spear phishing to spread malware.\n\n### Dropper\n\n**MD5 hash** 979eff03faeaeea5310df53ee1a2fc8e\n\n**Name** dvkmailer.zip\n\n**Archive contents**\n\nd6e813a393f40c7375052a15e940bc67 CsvHelper.dll Legit .NET CSV files\nparser\n\n\n-----\n\n664a15bdc747c560c11aa0cf1a7bf06e Telegram\nMessenger.exe\n\n\nPersistence and\nlauncher\n\n\n87126c8489baa8096c6f30456f5bef5e TelegramApi.dll Network module\n\nd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e Settings.json Empty\n\n### Launcher\n\n**MD5 hash** 664a15bdc747c560c11aa0cf1a7bf06e\n\n**File name** Telegram Messenger.exe\n\n**PE timestamp** 2018.03.18 21:34:12 (GMT)\n\n**Linker version** 2.25 (Embarcadero Delphi)\n\nBefore any user interaction, inside the FormCreate() function the launcher checks for a file\nnamed TelegramApi.dll in the same directory. If it exists, the launcher copies the network\nmodule to the startup directory as Java.exe and runs it.\n\nDelphi Visual Component Library (VCL) programs are based on event handlers for form\nelements. Such programs are extremely large (about 2.6 MB and 12,000 functions), but all\nthis code is mostly used to handle the visual components and run-time libraries. There are\nonly three programmer-defined handlers for controlling elements inside the Octopus\nlauncher.\n\n**Function name** **Functionality**\n\nFormCreate() Runs as constructor before any user activity. Makes the network\nmodule persistent via Startup directory and runs it\n\nButton1Click() Shows the explorer dialog window to choose the “mailing file”\n\nDateTimePicker1Click() Shows calendar to select the “mailing date”\n\nThere is no handler for the ‘Send mailing’ button, so the launcher pretends to be an\nalternative communicator that in reality does nothing. This may be because the malware is\nstill unfinished – after all, messages sent through it could be of value to the attackers.\nHowever, we believe it is more likely that the malware was created in a hurry and the\nattackers decided to skip any communication features.\n\n### Network module\n\n\n-----\n\n_C2 communication scheme_\n\n**MD5 hash** 87126c8489baa8096c6f30456f5bef5e\n\n**File name** TelegramApi.dll\n\n**PE timestamp** 2018.02.06 11:09:28 (GMT)\n\n**Linker version** 2.25 (Embarcadero Delphi)\n\nDespite the file extension, this network module is a self-sufficient portable executable file and\nnot a dynamic-link library. The first sample checks for files with names like 1?????????.* in\nthe user’s temporary folder and deletes any files it finds. Then it creates .profiles.ini in the\nApplication Data directory where the malware stores its log.\n\n**HTTP request** **Response**\n\nGET /d.php?check JSON “ok”\n\nGET /d.php?servers JSON domain name\n\nGET /i.php?check= JSON “ok”\n\nPOST /i.php?query= JSON response code or command depends on POST data\n\n\n-----\n\n_First stage .php script to check connection and get C2 domain name_\n\nAll network modules consist of hardcoded IP addresses belonging to commercial webhosting services based in different countries. The operators simply deploy their first-stage\n.php script in them, which will check the connection and get the actual C2 server domain\nname using an HTTP GET request.\n\n_After the initial connection check, the malware receives a JSON with the actual C2 domain name_\n\n_Then the network module checks against the hardcoded victim’s id_\n\nThe network module checks against a 32-digit hardcoded victim id and sends the gathered\ndata to the C2 using a HTTP POST request. In terms of programming, this id is strange,\nbecause the malware simultaneously ‘fingerprints’ its victim with an MD5 hash of its system\ndata.\n\n\n-----\n\n_JSON-based gathered data sent in a HTTP POST base64-encoded request_\n\nAll communication with the C2s is based on JSON-formatted data and the HTTP protocol.\nFor that, the developers used The Indy Project (indyproject.org) publicly available library as\nwell as the third-party TurboPower Abbrevia (sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia) for\ncompression.\n\nAfter all the initial HTTP GET requests, the malware starts to gather JSON-formatted system\ndata. For all the fixed drives in the system, the network module stores the disk name and\nsize, as well as computer and user name, Windows directory, host IP, etc. One interesting\nfield is “vr”:”2.0″ which appears to be the malware version encoded in the communication\nprotocol.\n\nThe ‘id’ field is the victim’s fingerprint for which the malware actively uses the Windows\nManagement Instrumentation mechanism. The Trojan runs WMIC.exe with the following\narguments:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\wbem\\WMIC.exe computersystem get Name /format:list\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\wbem\\WMIC.exe os get installdate /format:list\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\wbem\\WMIC.exe path CIM_LogicalDiskBasedOnPartition get\nAntecedent,Dependent\n\nThen the module concatenates the gathered ids and computes an MD5 hash, which will be\nthe victim’s final id. The “act” field numbers the communication stage (0 for initial\nfingerprinting) After this the HTTP POST control server returns a JSON {“rt”:”30″} and the\n\n\n-----\n\nclient continues with the next act in the HTTP POST:\n\nAt this point the C2 sends a JSON with commands to execute, including\nuploading/downloading files, taking a screenshot and finding *.rar archives on the host.\n\n### Other software\n\n[Besides the Trojan itself, the Octopus developers used the password dumping utility fgdump.](http://foofus.net/goons/fizzgig/fgdump/)\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\n**MD5 hash** **IPs** **C2 domain**\n\n\n87126c8489baa8096c6f30456f5bef5e 185.106.120.27\n\n204.145.94.10\n\nee3c829e7c773b4f94b700902ea3223c\n\n38f30749a87dcbf156689300737a094e 185.106.120.240\n\n204.145.94.101\n\n6e85996c021d55328322ce8e93b31088 5.188.231.101\n\n103.208.86.238\n\n7c0050a3e7aa3172392dcbab3bb92566 5.8.88.87\n\n103.208.86.237\n\n2bf2f63c927616527a693edf31ecebea 85.93.31.141\n\n104.223.20.136\n\nd9ad277eb23b6268465edb3f68b12cb2 5.188.231.101\n\n103.208.86.238\n\n\nporenticofacts.com\n\ncertificatesshop.com\n\nblondehairman.com\n\nlatecafe.in\n\nhovnanflovers.com\n\nblondehairman.com\n\n\n_The most recent samples (2017-2018) of hardcoded IPs and web domains obtained from the_\n_.php script_\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPolitical entities in Central Asia have been targeted throughout 2018 by different actors,\nincluding IndigoZebra, Sofacy (with Zebrocy malware) and most recently by DustSquad (with\nOctopus malware). Interestingly, we observed some victims who are ‘threat magnets’\n\n\n-----\n\ntargeted by all of them. From our experience we can say that the interest shown by threat\nactors in this region is now high, and the traditional ‘players’ have been joined by relative\nnewcomers like DustSquad that have sprung up locally.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**File hashes**\n\n87126c8489baa8096c6f30456f5bef5e\n\nee3c829e7c773b4f94b700902ea3223c\n\n38f30749a87dcbf156689300737a094e\n\n6e85996c021d55328322ce8e93b31088\n\n7c0050a3e7aa3172392dcbab3bb92566\n\n2bf2f63c927616527a693edf31ecebea\n\nd9ad277eb23b6268465edb3f68b12cb2\n\n**Domains and IPs**\n\n85.93.31.141\n\n104.223.20.136\n\n5.8.88.87\n\n103.208.86.237\n\n185.106.120.240\n\n204.145.94.101\n\n5.188.231.101\n\n103.208.86.238\n\n185.106.120.27\n\n204.145.94.10\n\nhovnanflovers.com\n\nlatecafe.in\n\ncertificatesshop.com\n\nblondehairman.com\n\nporenticofacts.com\n\n**Auxiliary URLs to upload/download files:**\n\nwww.fayloobmennik.net/files/save_new.html\n\nhttp://uploadsforyou.com/download/\n\nhttp://uploadsforyou.com/remove/\n\n**The following are old indicators of compromise no longer used by this actor, but**\n**which can be used for forensic purposes:**\n\n\n-----\n\n031e4900715564a21d0217c22609d73f\n1610cddb80d1be5d711feb46610f8a77\n1ce9548eae045433a0c943a07bb0570a\n3a54b3f9e9bd54b4098fe592d805bf72\n546ab9cdac9a812aab3e785b749c89b2\n5cbbdce774a737618b8aa852ae754251\n688854008f567e65138c3c34fb2562d0\n6fda541befa1ca675d9a0cc310c49061\n73d5d104b34fc14d32c04b30ce4de4ae\n88ad67294cf53d521f8295aa1a7b5c46\na90caeb6645b6c866ef60eb2d5f2d0c5\nae4e901509b05022bbe7ef340f4ad96c\nca743d10d27277584834e72afefd6be8\nce45e69eac5c55419f2c30d9a8c9104b\ndf392cd03909ad5cd7dcea83ee6d66a0\ne149c1da1e05774e6b168b6b00272eb4\nf625ba7f9d7577db561d4a39a6bb134a\nfc8b5b2f0b1132527a2bcb5985c2fe6b\nf7b1503a48a46e3269e6c6b537b033f8\n4f4a8898b0aa4507dbb568dca1dedd38\n\n**First stage .php script placed at:**\n\n148.251.185.168\n\n185.106.120.46\n\n185.106.120.47\n\n46.249.52.244\n\n5.255.71.84\n\n5.255.71.85\n\n88.198.204.196\n\n92.63.88.142\n\n**Domains returned by .php script:**\n\ngiftfromspace.com\n\nmikohanzer.website\n\nhumorpics.download\n\ndesperados20.es\n\nprom3.biz.ua\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Dropper](https://securelist.com/tag/dropper/)\n[Russian-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/russian-speaking-cybercrime/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nOctopus-infested seas of Central Asia\n\nYour email address will not be published.
