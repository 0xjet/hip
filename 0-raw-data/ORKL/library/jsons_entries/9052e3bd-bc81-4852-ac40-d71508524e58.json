    "plain_text": "# Iranian intel cyber suite of malware uses open source tools\n\n**[cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)**\n\nJanuary 12, 2022\n\nFORT MEADE, Md. –\nTo better enable defense against malicious cyber actors, U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber\nNational Mission Force has identified and disclosed multiple open-source tools that Iranian\nintelligence actors are using in networks around the world.\n\nThese actors, known as MuddyWater in industry, are part of groups conducting Iranian\nintelligence activities, and have been seen using a variety of techniques to maintain access\nto victim networks.\n\nMuddyWater is an Iranian threat group; previously, industry has reported that MuddyWater\nhas primarily targeted Middle Eastern nations, and has also targeted European and North\nAmerican nations.\n\nMuddyWater is a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security\n(MOIS). According to the [Congressional Research Service, the MOIS “conducts domestic](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32048)\nsurveillance to identify regime opponents It also surveils anti-regime activists abroad\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough its network of agents placed in Iran s embassies.\n\nShould a network operator identify multiple of the tools on the same network, it may indicate\nthe presence of Iranian malicious cyber actors.\n\nBelow are some technical aspects of how the threat actor could be leveraging malware in\nnetworks.\n\nThese include side-loading DLLs in order to trick legitimate programs into running malware\nand obfuscating PowerShell scripts to hide command and control functions. New samples\nshowing the different parts of this suite of tools are posted to Virus Total, along with\nJavaScript files used to establish connections back to malicious infrastructure.\n\nwww.Virustotal.com/en/user/CYBERCOM_Malware_Alert\n\n**Previous PowGoop Sample:**\n\nThese three samples are all part of the same PowGoop instance. They were\nidentified in a folder with several other legitimate executables and DLLs.\nGoopdate.dll uses DLL side-loading to run when a the non-malicious executable\nGoogleUpdate.exe is run. goopdate.dll will then de-obfuscate goopdate.dat,\nwhich is a PowerShell script used to de-obfuscate and run config.txt. Config.txt is\na PowerShell script that establishes network communication with the PowGoop\nC2 server. It uses a modified base64 encoding mechanism to send data to and\nfrom the C2 server. The IP of the C2 server is often hardcoded in config.txt\nGoopdate.dll hides comms with malicious cyber actors’ C2 servers by executing\nwith Google Update service.\n**Additional PowGoop DLL Side-Loading variants:**\n\nUses same technique to de-obfuscate .dat file, which is a PowerShell script to\ndecode another PowerShell script with .txt file extension\n**This open source code has been used for espionage & ransomware-- libpcre2-8-**\n0.dll & vcruntime140.dll (PowGoop variant) leverage different naming conventions\nto avoid antivirus & manual detection.\n**Additional PowGoop Loader variants:**\n\nAny instances of these files may indicate an attacker in the network: Open-source\ncyber research found PowGoop Loader variants in compromised networks, deobfuscating a PowerShell script that allows an attacker command and control\nfunctions.\nDe-obfuscates .txt file, which is another PowerShell script and main C2\nfunctionality\n\n\n-----\n\n**Additional PowGoop C2 Beacon variants:**\n\nThese malware reach out from victim networks & contact malicious\ninfrastructure. If you see these files, MCAs are likely seeing their beacon too.\nEach sample reaches out from the victim network and contacts malicious\ninfrastructure. If you see these files on the network, chances are they are seeing\ntheir beacon as well.\n**JavaScript samples:**\n\nThe samples issue a GET request to malicious servers. The JavaScripts are\nassociated with groups also employing PowGoop.\n**Mori Backdoor sample:**\n\nThis sample is an indicator that a network has been compromised – this is the\nMori Backdoor and is employed by malicious cyber actors for espionage. This\nmalware uses DNS tunneling to communicate to its C2 infrastructure.\nThis sample is a likely Mori Backdoor. This sample utilizes regsvr32.dll to run.\nKey IOCs are the creation of the Mutex 0x50504060 and creation of the registry\nkey HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\NFC\n\n\n-----",
