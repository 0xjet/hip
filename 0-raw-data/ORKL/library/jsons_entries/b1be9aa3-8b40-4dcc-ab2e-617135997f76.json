This change in tactics makes PINCHY SPIDER and its affiliates the latest eCrime\nadversaries to join the growing trend of targeted, low-volume/high-return ransomware\n[deployments known as “big game hunting.”](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyber-big-game-hunting/)\n\nPINCHY SPIDER is the criminal group behind the development of the ransomware most\ncommonly known as GandCrab, which has been active since January 2018. PINCHY\nSPIDER sells access to use GandCrab ransomware under a partnership program with a\nlimited number of accounts. The program is operated with a 60-40 split in profits (60 percent\nto the customer), as is common among eCrime actors, but PINCHY SPIDER is also willing to\nnegotiate up to a 70-30 split for “sophisticated” customers.\n\n## GandCrab: Highly Developed and Prevalent\n\nGandCrab has established itself as one of the most developed and prevalent ransomware\nfamilies on the market. Development of the ransomware itself has been driven, in part, by\nPINCHY SPIDER’s interactions with the cybersecurity research community. GandCrab\n\n\n-----\n\ncontains multiple references to members of the research community who are both publicly\nactive on social media and have reported on the ransomware.\n\nThe main catalyst for dedicated development by PINCHY SPIDER, however, has been an\nongoing battle with cybersecurity providers that are actively developing GandCrab\nmitigations and decryptors. PINCHY SPIDER has responded by deploying fixes and even\n[developed a zero-day exploit aimed at customers of one of those providers.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-author-bitter-after-security-vendor-releases-vaccine-app/)\n\n## PINCHY SPIDER Advertises for Affiliates\n\nPINCHY SPIDER has continued to promote the success of its ransomware in criminal forum\nposts, often boasting about public reporting of GandCrab incidents. In February, PINCHY\nSPIDER released version 5.2 of GandCrab, which is immune to the decryption tools\ndeveloped for earlier versions of GandCrab and in fact, was deployed the day before the\nrelease of the [latest decryptor.](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html#GandCrabV1V4andV5uptoV51versions)\n\nRecently PINCHY SPIDER has also been observed advertising for individuals with remote\ndesktop protocol (RDP) and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) skills, and spammers who\nhave experience in corporate networking.\n\n## GandCrab Identified by CrowdStrike Intel\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence first identified new GandCrab ransomware deployment tactics in\nmid-February, when a threat actor was observed performing actions on a victim host in order\nto install GandCrab. Though initially unsuccessful, the threat actor returned later to perform\nfurther reconnaissance on the victim network. The following day, the threat actor returned a\nthird time and manually removed security software from the host that was preventing the\ninstallation of GandCrab.\n\nUsing RDP and stolen credentials from the initially compromised host, the threat actor then\nproceeded to move laterally around the victim network and was able to deploy GandCrab\nacross several other hosts.\n\nThroughout the reconnaissance process, the threat actor used system administration tools\nsuch as Sysinternals Process Monitor, Process Hacker, and a file search tool called LAN\nSearch Pro to assist with the collection of information from the hosts. Details of the affiliates,\nand GandCrab versions observed adopting these tactics, can be seen in Table 1.\n\n**Affiliate ID** **Sub-group ID** **GandCrab Version**\n\n23 23 5.2\n\n110 1276 5.1\n\nTable 1. GandCrab Affiiates Observed Adopting Big Game Hunting Tactics\n\n\n-----\n\n## Domain Controller Access Observed\n\nNear the end of February, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed another incident in which\nsimilar manual lateral movement techniques were used to deploy GandCrab across multiple\nhosts in an enterprise. This incident began with a compromise that resulted in the threat\nactor gaining control of the enterprise domain controller. Once Domain Controller access was\nacquired, the threat actor used the enterprise’s own IT systems management software,\nLANDesk, to deploy a loader to hosts across the enterprise.\n\nThis loader, known as Phorpiex Downloader, is not specifically tied to GandCrab or PINCHY\nSPIDER, and it has previously been observed dropping other malware, such as Smoke Bot,\nAzorult, and XMRig. In this instance, Phorpiex served two main purposes for the threat actor.\nFirst, it spread itself to all removable drives on the infected hosts in order to further\npropagate throughout the network. Second, it downloaded and executed GandCrab on the\ninfected hosts.\n\n## Expanding to Adopt “Big Game Hunting” Tactics\n\nThe change in deployment tactics observed in these recent incidents, coupled with PINCHY\nSPIDER’s advertising for individuals with skills in RDP/VNC and experience in corporate\nnetworking, suggest PINCHY SPIDER and their affiliates are expanding to adopt big game\nhunting tactics.\n\nThe one difference in the tactics adopted by PINCHY SPIDER, versus most other\nadversaries who practice big game hunting, is the monetization model. Typically, a single\npayment would be requested to unlock the whole enterprise, as has been observed in\nINDRIK SPIDER and GRIM SPIDER intrusions. However, PINCHY SPIDER is encrypting\nindividual hosts on the enterprise network and requesting payment on a per-host basis. It\nshould be noted that PINCHY SPIDER is not completely alone in this strategy. BOSS\nSPIDER used both enterprise and per-host pricing during their campaigns.\n\n[As reported in the CrowdStrike 2018 Global Threat Report, big game hunting was a trend](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2018-crowdstrike-global-threat-report-blurring-the-lines-between-statecraft-and-tradecraft)\nthat helped define the criminal threat landscape in 2018. This latest activity underscores the\nfact that additional eCrime adversaries are aspiring to adopt this operational model. Both\nINDRIK SPIDER (with [BitPaymer ransomware) and GRIM SPIDER (with](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/) [Ryuk ransomware)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)\nhave made headlines with their high profile victims and ransom profits, demonstrating that\nbig game hunting is a lucrative enterprise. Running successful big game hunting operations\nresults in a higher average profit per victim, allowing adversaries like PINCHY SPIDER and\ntheir partners to increase their criminal revenue quickly.\n\n## Related Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOCs**\n\n**Phorpiex Loader SHA256**\n\n5a1ab27b99f3fe6cbe825f2743c77347a7339783f8a22d99a54be2d07b94c1a8\n\nTable 2.
