We thought what to do,\ninstalled POS malware and left it for a year. Before the lock, the cards were collected and\ndeciphered, for a whole year the company did not suspect and did nothing,\" the CLOP gang\ntold BleepingComputer.\n\nUsing the installed POS malware, CLOP told BleepingComputer that they stole the Track 2\ndata for 2 million credit cards over the past year.\n\n**Redacted sample of Track 2 data allegedly stolen by CLOP**\nPOS malware is used to scan the memory of point-of-sale (POS) terminals as credit card\ntransactions occur. When credit card data is detected, the malware copies the credit card\ninformation as Track 1 or Track 2 data and transmits it back to the threat actor's server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[POS malware attack model (Carbon Black)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/visa-warns-of-ongoing-cyber-attacks-on-gas-pump-pos-systems/)**\nThe stolen credit cards that CLOP claims to have stolen are in the form of Track 2 data,\nwhich includes a credit card number, the expiration date, and other information. It does not,\nthough, contain a credit cards CVV code, so threat actors can only use it to create fake\ncredit cards for in-store purchases.\n\nCLOP also told BleepingComputer that they targeted approximately 90k IP addresses, but\nare unsure as to how many were actually encrypted.\n\nBleepingComputer has made repeated attempts to contact E-Land Global and E-Land\nRetail but have not received a reply to our emails.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Microsoft: Credit card stealers are getting much stealthier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-credit-card-stealers-are-getting-much-stealthier/)\n\n[Clop](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/clop/)\n[Credit Card](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/credit-card/)\n[E-Land](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/e-land/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[E-Land Retail](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/e-land-retail/)\n[POS Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/pos-malware/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
