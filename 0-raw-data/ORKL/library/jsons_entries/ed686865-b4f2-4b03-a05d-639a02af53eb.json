The group has\nbeen running campaigns, mostly in countries and territories around the South China Sea,\nsince as early as 2012. The main targets of Spring Dragon attacks are high profile\ngovernmental organizations and political parties, education institutions such as universities,\nas well as companies from the telecommunications sector.\n\nIn the beginning of 2017, Kaspersky Lab became aware of new activities by an APT actor we\nhave been tracking for several years called Spring Dragon (also known as LotusBlossom).\n\nInformation about the new attacks arrived from a research partner in Taiwan and we decided\nto review the actor’s tools, techniques and activities.\n\nUsing Kaspersky Lab telemetry data we detected the malware in attacks against some highprofile organizations around the South China Sea.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpring Dragon is known for spear phishing and watering hole techniques and some of its\ntools have previously been analyzed and reported on by security researchers, including\n[Kaspersky Lab. We collected a large set (600+) of malware samples used in different](https://securelist.com/the-spring-dragon-apt/70726/)\nattacks, with customized C2 addresses and campaign codes hardcoded in the malware\nsamples.\n\n## Spring Dragon’s Toolset\n\nThe threat actor behind Spring Dragon APT has been developing and updating its range of\ntools throughout the years it has been operational. Its toolset consists of various backdoor\nmodules with unique characteristics and functionalities.\n\nThe threat actor owns a large C2 infrastructure which comprises more than 200 unique IP\naddresses and C2 domains.\n\nThe large number of samples which we have managed to collect have customized\nconfiguration data, different sets of C2 addresses with new hardcoded campaign IDs, as well\nas customized configuration data for creating a service for malware on a victim’s system.\nThis is designed to make detection more difficult.\n\nAll the backdoor modules in the APT’s toolset are capable of downloading more files onto the\nvictim’s machine, uploading files to the attacker’s servers, and also executing any executable\nfile or any command on the victim’s machine. These functionalities enable the attackers to\nundertake different malicious activities on the victim’s machine.\n\nA detailed analysis of known malicious tools used by this threat actor is available for\ncustomers of Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Services.\n\n## Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure\n\nThe main modules in Spring Dragon attacks are backdoor files containing IP addresses and\ndomain names of C2 servers. We collected and analyzed information from hundreds of C2 IP\naddresses and domain names used in different samples of Spring Dragon tools that have\nbeen compiled over the years.\n\nIn order to hide their real location, attackers have registered domain names and used IP\naddresses from different geographical locations. The chart below shows the distribution of\nservers based on geographical location which the attackers used as their C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Distribution chart of C2 servers by country_\n\nMore than 40% of all the C2 servers used for Spring Dragon’s operations are located in\nHong Kong, which hints at the geographical region (Asia) of the attackers and/or their\ntargets. The next most popular countries are the US, Germany, China and Japan.\n\n## Targets of the Attacks\n\nAs was mentioned, the Spring Dragon threat actor has been mainly targeting countries and\nterritories around the South China Sea with a particular focus on Taiwan, Indonesia,\nVietnam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nOur research shows that the main targets of the attacks are in the following sectors and\nindustries:\n\nHigh-profile governmental organizations\nPolitical parties\nEducation institutions, including universities\nCompanies from the telecommunications sector\n\nThe following map shows the geographic distribution of attacks according to our telemetry,\nwith the frequency of the attacks increasing from yellow to red.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Geographic map of attacks_\n\n## Origin of the Attacks\n\nThe victims of this threat actor have always been mainly governmental organizations and\npolitical parties. These are known to be of most interest to state-supported groups.\n\nThe type of malicious tools the actor has implemented over time are mostly backdoor files\ncapable of stealing files from victims’ systems, downloading and executing additional\nmalware components as well as running system commands on victims’ machines. This\nsuggests an intention to search and manually collect information (cyberespionage). This\nactivity is most commonly associated with the interests of state-sponsored attackers.\n\nAs a routine analysis procedure, we decided to figure out the attacker’s possible time zone\nusing the malware compilation timestamps from a large number of Spring Dragon samples.\nThe following diagram shows the frequency of the timestamps during daytime hours. The\ntimestamps range from early 2012 until now and are aligned to the GMT time zone.\n\nAssuming the peak working hours of malware developers are the standard working day of\n09:00-17:00, the chart shows that compilation took place in the GMT+8 time zone. It also\nsuggests that either there is a second group working another shift in the same time zone or\nthe attackers are cross-continental and there is another group, possibly in Europe. The\nuneven distribution of timestamps (low activity around 10am, 7-8pm UTC) suggests that the\nattackers didn’t change the timestamps to random or constant values and they might be real.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Histogram of malware files’ timestamps_\n\n## Conclusions\n\nSpring Dragon is one of many long-running APT campaigns by unknown Chinese-speaking\nactors. The number of malware samples which we managed to collect (over 600) for the\ngroup surpassed many others, and suggests an operation on a massive scale. It’s possible\nthat this malware toolkit is offered in specialist public or private forums to any buyers,\nalthough, to date, we haven’t seen this.\n\nWe believe that Spring Dragon is going to continue resurfacing regularly in the Asian region\nand it is therefore worthwhile having good detection mechanisms (such as Yara rules and\nnetwork IDS signatures) in place. We will continue to track this group going forward and,\nshould the actor resurface, we will provide updates on its new modus operandi.\n\nMore information is available to Kaspersky Lab private report subscribers.
