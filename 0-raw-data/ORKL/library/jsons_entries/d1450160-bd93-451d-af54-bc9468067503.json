    "plain_text": "# SNAKEMACKEREL delivers Zekapab malware\n\n**[accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-snakemackerel-delivers-zekapab-malware](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-snakemackerel-delivers-zekapab-malware)**\n\nAs the United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Theresa May announced the initial BREXIT draft\nagreement with the European Union (EU), iDefense analysts identified a new campaign by\nSNAKEMACKEREL using a BREXIT-themed lure document to deliver the Zekapab (also\nknown as Zebrocy) first-stage malware.\n\n**What's the story?**\n\nSNAKEMACKEREL is an espionage-motivated cyber threat group, also known as Sofacy,\nPawn Storm, Sednit, Fancy Bear, APT28, Group 74, Tsar Team, and Strontium.\n\nBoth the British and Dutch governments have publicly attributed SNAKEMACKEREL\nactivities to the Russian military intelligence service (RIS)1 and have linked specific\ncyberattacks to the group, including the targeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of\nChemical Weapons (OPCW)2, the United Kingdom Defence and Science Technology\nLaboratory (DSTL) and the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).\n\nIn foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyberattacks,\nincluding attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded\nas third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to\nmisattribute the source of the attack.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the FBI, the SNAKEMACKEREL threat group is part of an ongoing campaign\nof cyber-enabled operations directed at the United States government and its citizens. These\ncyber operations have included spear phishing campaigns targeting government\norganizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations,\nand corporations, leading to the theft of information.\n\n**[Download the report [PDF].](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-90/Accenture-snakemackerel-delivers-zekapab-malware.pdf#zoom=50)**\n\n**What does it mean?**\n\nThe creation of this malicious document, coming on the day the UK government announced\nan initial agreed draft of the BREXIT agreement, suggests that SNAKEMACKEREL is a\ngroup that pays close attention to political affairs and is able to leverage the latest news\nheadlines to develop lure documents to deliver first-stage malware, such as Zekapab, to its\nintended targets. The theme also reflects the targeting of the group which primarily focuses\non NATO members, countries in Central Asia and those neighboring Russia.\n\nGiven the assumed association with the Russian military service, it is clear that the group\nhas significant resources to target and compromise organizations. As a result, it requires\nextra investment in defensive measures. To protect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of business operations, Accenture Security recommends that organizations\nensure their staff members receive security hygiene training and deploy intelligence-driven\nnetwork and host-based defensive measures.\n\n**Why does it matter?**\n\nDespite the public reporting and government accusations, SNAKEMACKEREL remains\nhighly active. It is behind a large number of cyberattacks targeting global aerospace and\ndefense contractors, military units, political parties, the International Olympic Committee\n(IOC), anti-doping agencies, government departments and various other verticals. NATO and\nEU member countries, as well as the United States, are of particular interest to the group.\n\nSNAKEMACKEREL operations continue to be some of the most far-reaching and\nsophisticated cyber espionage and intelligence campaigns to date.\n\nAccenture Security\n\nAccenture Security is a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including\nadvanced cyber defense, applied cybersecurity solutions and managed security operations.\nWe bring security innovation, coupled with global scale and a worldwide delivery capability\nthrough our network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
