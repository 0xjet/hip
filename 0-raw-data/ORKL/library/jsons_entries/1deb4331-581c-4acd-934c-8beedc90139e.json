The past few years have seen high-profile cyber-attacks shift to damaging the\ntargets’ digital infrastructures to stealing highly sensitive data, silently monitoring the victim\nand constantly laying the ground for a new wave of attacks.\n\nThis is also the case of a custom-built piece of malware that we have been monitoring for\nseveral months as it wrought havoc in Asia. Our threat intelligence systems picked up the\nfirst indicators of compromise in July last year, and we have kept an eye on the threat ever\nsince.\n\nAn interesting feature of this threat, which drew our team to the challenge of analyzing it, is\nthat it features a network of malicious subdomains, each one used for a specific task\n(download, upload, RAT related actions, malware DLL delivery). The payloads are diversified\nand include capabilities to download and execute additional binary files, collect private\ninformation and remotely execute commands on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the analysis process, we managed to retrieve the malware payloads hosted on one of the\ncommand and control servers along with some statistics, such as the total number of\ndownloads and logs containing the targeted victims. Among the most-downloaded malicious\nfiles, we found variants of Gh0st RAT used in Iron Tiger APT operation [more information\n[about Iron Tiger is available in a research paper published by TrendMicro]. Interestingly](https://github.com/CyberMonitor/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin_Collections/tree/master/2015/2015.09.17.Operation_Iron_Tiger)\nenough, these new samples now connect to the new attack infrastructure.\n\nThis whitepaper takes an in-depth look at the the attack chain, the infrastructure used by the\nthreat actors, the malware subdomains they control and the payloads delivered on the\ntargeted systems, as well as other telltale signs about a possible return of the Iron Tiger APT.\n\n[Download the whitepaper](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/185/Bitdefender-Business-2017-WhitePaper-PZCHAO-crea2452-en-EN-GenericUse.pdf)\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [whitepapers](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/whitepapers/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Ivona Alexandra CHILI\n\nI'm a Forensics Engineer in the Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab at Bitdefender.
