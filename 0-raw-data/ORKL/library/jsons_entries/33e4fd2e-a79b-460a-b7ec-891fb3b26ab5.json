Turns out, the easiest way for a reporter to make sure everything hits**\nthe fan from a cybersecurity perspective is to take a two week vacation to the other end of\nthe world. What follows is a timeline that helped me get my head on straight about the events\nthat preceded this breach, followed by some analysis and links to other perspectives on the\nmatter.\n\n**July 2014: OPM investigates a**\nbreach of its computer networks\ndating back to March 2014.\nAuthorities trace the intrusion to\nChina. OPM offers employees free\ncredit monitoring and assures\nemployees that no personal data\nappears to have been stolen.\n\n**Aug. 2014: It emerges that USIS, a**\nbackground check provider for the\n\nOPM offices in Washington, DC. Image: Flickr.\n\n**U.S. Department of Homeland**\n**Security, was hacked. USIS** [offers](http://archive.federaltimes.com/article/20140918/MGMT03/309180013/USIS-offers-DHS-employees-credit-monitoring-after-breach)\n27,000 DHS employees credit monitoring through AllClearID (full disclosure: AllClear is an\n\n\n-----\n\nadvertiser on this blog). Investigators say Chinese are hackers responsible, and that the\nattackers broke in by [exploiting a vulnerability in an enterprise management software product](http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/05/third-party-software-was-entry-point-background-check-system-hack/112354/)\nfrom SAP. OPM soon suspends work with USIS.\n\n**November 2014: A** [report (PDF) by OPM’s Office of the Inspector General on the](http://www.opm.gov/news/reports-publications/semi-annual-reports/sar52.pdf)\n[agency’s compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act finds “significant”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act_of_2002)\ndeficiencies in the department’s IT security. The report found OPM did not maintain a\ncomprehensive inventory of servers, databases and network devices, nor were auditors able\nto tell if OPM even had a vulnerability scanning program. The audit also found that multifactor authentication (the use of a token such as a smart card, along with an access code)\nwas not required to access OPM systems. “We believe that the volume and sensitivity of\nOPM systems that are operating without an active Authorization represents a material\nweakness in the internal control structure of the agency’s IT security program,” the report\nconcluded.\n\n**Dec. 2014: KeyPoint, a company that took over background checks for USIS, suffers**\nbreach. OPM states that there is “no conclusive evidence to confirm sensitive information\nwas removed from the system.” OPM vows to notify 48,439 federal workers that their\ninformation may have been exposed in the attack.\n\n**[Feb. 2015: Health insurance giant Anthem discloses breach impacting nearly 80 million](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/data-breach-at-health-insurer-anthem-could-impact-millions/)**\ncustomers. Experts later trace domains, IP addresses implicated in attack to Chinese\nhackers. Anthem [offers two years of free credit monitoring services through AllClearID.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCoQFjACahUKEwj_-sPKgZHGAhULkA0KHdrSDHw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fanthem.allclearid.com%2F&ei=tmh-Vf_HN4ugNtqls-AH&usg=AFQjCNHyDfcWZ8qhaGwUhwemB1k1GzIoiQ&sig2=q7dZYgHHzLN4ZS9ZSiLZKQ&bvm=bv.95515949,d.eXY)\n\n**May 2015: Premera Blue Cross, one of the insurance carriers that participates in the Federal**\nEmployees Health Benefits Program, discloses a breach affecting 11 million customers.\nFederal auditors at OPM [warned Premera three weeks prior to the breach that its network](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/feds-warned-premera-about-security-flaws-before-breach/)\nsecurity procedures were inadequate. Unlike the Anthem breach, the incident at Premera\nexposes clinical medical information in addition to personally identifiable information.\n[Premera offers two years of free credit monitoring through Experian.](http://www.premeraupdate.com/free-credit-monitoring)\n\n**May 2015: Carefirst Blue Cross discloses breach impacting 1.1 million customers. Clues**\n[unearthed by researchers point to the same attack infrastructure and methods used in the](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/carefirst-blue-cross-breach-hits-1-1m/)\n[Anthem and Premera breach. Carefirst offers two years free credit monitoring through](http://www.carefirstanswers.com/monitoring.html)\nExperian.\n\n**[June 2015: OPM discloses breach affecting up to 4 million federal employees, offers 18](https://www.csid.com/opm/)**\nmonths of free credit monitoring through CSID. Follow-up reports indicate that the breach\nmay extend well beyond federal employees to individuals who applied for security clearances\nwith the federal government.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the OPM s Inspector General report put it, attacks like the ones on Anthem and Premera\n\n[and OPM] are likely to increase. In these cases, the risk to Federal employees and their\nfamilies will probably linger long after the free credit monitoring offered by these companies\nexpires.”\n\nThat would appear to be the understatement of the year. The OPM runs a little program\n[called e-QIP, which processes applications for security clearances for federal agencies,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-QIP)\n[including top secret and above. This bit, from a July 10, 2014 story in The Washington Post,](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-go-after-us-workers-personal-data/2014/07/10/92db92e8-0846-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html)\nputs the depth and breadth of this breach in better perspective:\n\n“In those files are huge treasure troves of personal data, including “applicants’ financial\nhistories and investment records, children’s and relatives’ names, foreign trips taken\nand contacts with foreign nationals, past residences, and names of neighbors and\nclose friends such as college roommates and co-workers. Employees log in using their\nSocial Security numbers.”\n\nThat quote aptly explains why a nation like China might wish to hoover up data from the\nOPM and a network of healthcare providers that serve federal employees: If you were a state\nand wished to recruit foreign spies or uncover traitors within your own ranks, what sort of\ngoldmine might this data be? Imagine having access to files that include interviews with a\ntarget’s friends and acquaintances over the years, some of whom could well have shared\nuseful information about that person’s character flaws, weaknesses and proclivities.\n\nFor its part, China has steadfastly denied involvement. Politico cites a news story from\n[the Chinese news service Xinhua which dismissed the U.S. allegations as “obviously another](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-06/05/c_134300869.htm)\ncase of Washington’s habitual slander against Beijing on cybersecurity.”\n\n“It also pointed to the information disclosed by former NSA subcontractor Edward Snowden,\nsaying the U.S. itself is guilty of ‘large-scale, organized cyber theft, wiretapping and\nsupervision of political figures, enterprises and individuals of other countries, including\nChina’,” Politico‘s David Perera [writes.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/personal-data-of-4-million-federal-employees-hacked-118655.html)\n\nThere are some who would say it is wrong or at least foolhardy to dwell on forensic data and\nother clues suggesting that hackers closely allied with the Chinese government were\ninvolved in these attacks. Indeed, there is a contingent of experts who argue that placing so\nmuch emphasis on attribution in these sorts of attacks is a diversion that distracts attention\nand resources from what really matters: learning from one’s mistakes and focusing on better\nsecuring and maintaining our critical systems.\n\n[As part of my visit to Australia (and then to gorgeous New Zealand) these past few weeks, I](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bfGYW.jpg)\nwas invited to speak at two separate security conferences. At one of them, my talk was\npreceded by a speech from Mike Burgess, chief information security officer at Telstra,\n\n\n-----\n\nAustralia s largest telecom provider. Burgess knows a few things about attribution: He is an\n[18-year veteran of the Australian Signals Directorate (formerly the Defence Signals](http://www.asd.gov.au/)\n**Directorate and the Australian equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency).**\n\nIn his speech, Burgess railed against media reports about high-profile cyber attacks that\ncreated an atmosphere of what he called “attribution distraction” and “threat distraction.” A\nreporter with [ZDNet captured Burgess’s thoughts with this quote:](http://www.zdnet.com/article/telstra-ciso-blasts-cyber-attribution-distraction/)\n\n“Don’t get me wrong….I’m not saying that attribution isn’t important. I’m not saying that\nissues of source, great technical intelligence, and other forms of intelligence to\nunderstand the threat and the intentions of those looking to steal information from you,\nor disrupt your organisation for some purpose that may be unknown to you, [are not\nimportant].”\n\n“But what I observe, what I fear, what I see too much of, is many commentators, many\nin the industry, and many in media, focus on attribution, with very little focus on the root\ncause. No-one should lose valuable information where at the root cause there is a\nknown remedy. For me, that is unforgivable in this day and age. And I’ve got to tell you\n— my view at least — too much of this distraction around attribution takes away from\nfocusing on what’s really important here.”\n\nThere is, no doubt, a great deal of wisdom in Mr. Burgess’s words. After all, OPM clearly\ncould have been doing much more to beef up security around its very sensitive stores of\ndata. But perhaps Burgess was onto something for a different reason: At least as it relates to\nthe United States’ tenuous relations with China, having strong indicators of attribution in an\nattack of this magnitude puts the White House rather publicly between a rock and a hard\nplace.\n\nAs The New York Times [writes, the Obama administration now finds itself under pressure to](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/white-house-weighs-sanctions-after-second-breach-of-a-computer-system.html)\nrespond in some way, and is reportedly considering financial sanctions against China. But as\n_The National Journal wryly observes, this is a bit of an awkward position for a government_\nthat hardly holds the moral high ground when it comes to spying on and hoovering up data\nfrom foreign governments.\n\n“That’s partially because in the two years since Edward Snowden’s leaks about U.S.\nsurveillance, the Obama administration has repeatedly argued that hacking into computer\nnetworks to spy on foreigners is completely acceptable behavior,” [writes Brendan Sasso. “It](http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/does-nsa-spying-leave-the-u-s-without-moral-high-ground-in-china-hack-20150614)\nwon’t be so easy for the U.S. to express indignant outrage just because it’s on the opposite\nside of the surveillance this time.”\n\nIf you’re affected by these breaches and wondering what you can do to protect yourself\n[besides signing up for credit monitoring services, please see this story.](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/06/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-security-freeze/)\n\n\n-----",
