The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss\nongoing investigations, said the attackers used computer infrastructure and hacking tools\npreviously deployed by state-backed Chinese cyberspies.\n\nA USDA spokesman said in an email “USDA has notified all customers (including individuals\nand organizations) whose data has been affected by the SolarWinds Orion Code\nCompromise.”\n\nIn a follow-up statement after the story was published, a different USDA spokesman said the\nNFC was not hacked and that “there was no data breach related to Solar Winds” at the\nagency. He did not provide further explanation.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said attributing cyberattacks was a “complex technical issue”\nand any allegations should be supported with evidence. “China resolutely opposes and\ncombats any form of cyberattacks and cyber theft,” it said in a statement.\n\nSolarWinds said it was aware of a single customer that was compromised by the second set\nof hackers but that it had “not found anything conclusive” to show who was responsible. The\ncompany added that the attackers did not gain access to its own internal systems and that it\nhad released an update to fix the bug in December.\n\nFILE PHOTO: SolarWinds Corp. banner hangs at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on\nthe IPO day of the company in New York, U.S., October 19, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan\nMcDermid\n\nIn the case of the sole client it knew about, SolarWinds said the hackers only abused its\nsoftware once inside the client’s network. SolarWinds did not say how the hackers first got in,\nexcept to say it was “in a way that was unrelated to SolarWinds.”\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the two espionage efforts overlap and both targeted the U.S. government, they\nwere separate and distinctly different operations, according to four people who have\ninvestigated the attacks and outside experts who reviewed the code used by both sets of\nhackers.\n\nWhile the alleged Russian hackers penetrated deep into SolarWinds network and hid a “back\ndoor” in Orion software updates which were then sent to customers, the suspected Chinese\ngroup exploited a separate bug in Orion’s code to help spread across networks they had\nalready compromised, the sources said.\n\n‘EXTREMELY SERIOUS BREACH’\n\nThe side-by-side missions show how hackers are focusing on weaknesses in obscure but\nessential software products that are widely used by major corporations and government\nagencies.\n\n“Apparently SolarWinds was a high value target for more than one group,” said Jen MillerOsborn, the deputy director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit42.\n\nFormer U.S. chief information security officer Gregory Touhill said separate groups of\nhackers targeting the same software product was not unusual. “It wouldn’t be the first time\nwe’ve seen a nation-state actor surfing in behind someone else, it’s like ‘drafting’ in\nNASCAR,” he said, where one racing car gets an advantage by closely following another’s\nlead.\n\nThe connection between the second set of attacks on SolarWinds customers and suspected\nChinese hackers was only discovered in recent weeks, according to security analysts\ninvestigating alongside the U.S. government.\n\nReuters could not determine what information the attackers were able to steal from the\nNational Finance Center (NFC) or how deep they burrowed into its systems. But the potential\nimpact could be “massive,” former U.S. government officials told Reuters.\n\nThe NFC is responsible for handling the payroll of multiple government agencies, including\nseveral involved in national security, such as the FBI, State Department, Homeland Security\nDepartment and Treasury Department, the former officials said.\n\nRecords held by the NFC include federal employee social security numbers, phone numbers\nand personal email addresses as well as banking information. On its website, the NFC says\nit “services more than 160 diverse agencies, providing payroll services to more than 600,000\nFederal employees.”\n\n“Depending on what data were compromised, this could be an extremely serious breach of\nsecurity,” said Tom Warrick, a former senior official at the U.S Department of Homeland\nSecurity. “It could allow adversaries to know more about U.S. officials, improving their ability\n\n\n-----\n\nto collect intelligence.\n\nReporting by Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter in Washington, Joseph Menn in San\nFrancisco, and Jack Stubbs in London; Additional reporting by Brenda Goh in Shanghai;\nEditing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
