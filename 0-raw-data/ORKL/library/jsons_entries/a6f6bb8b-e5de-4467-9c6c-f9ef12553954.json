    "plain_text": "# Potential MuddyWater Campaign Seen in the Middle East\n\n**blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-**\ncentral-asia/\n\nMarch 12, 2018\n\nWe discovered a new campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan and Tajikistan\n[that has some similarities with an earlier campaign named MuddyWater, which hit various](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-cyber/saudi-agency-says-country-targeted-in-cyber-spying-campaign-idUSKBN1DK27M)\nindustries in several countries, primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia. Third party\nsecurity researchers named the MuddyWater campaign as such because of the difficulties in\nattributing the attacks. However, given the nature of the targets, as well as the gathering and\nuploading of information to C&C servers, it appears that the attackers are mainly concerned\nwith espionage activities — with the Saudi Arabia’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)\n[publishing an alert on their website regarding the attacks.](https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/ncsc/home/Alerts/!ut/p/z0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziDQ1dLDyM3A18_M29XQwcnQKD3UyN3Y0dfQ30C7IdFQEpg6mA/)\n\nGiven the number of similarities, we can assume that there is a connection between these\nnew attacks and the MuddyWater campaign. It also signifies that the attackers are not merely\ninterested in a one-off campaign, but will likely continue to perform cyberespionage activities\nagainst the targeted countries and industries.\n\n[Comparing the earlier MuddyWater campaign with this new one reveals some distinct](https://reaqta.com/2017/11/muddywater-apt-targeting-middle-east/)\nsimiliarities:\n\n**2017 MuddyWater Campaign** **2018 “MuddyWater” Campaign**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Countries of**\n**Targeted**\n**Organizations**\n\n**Decoy**\n**Documents**\n\n\nGeorgia, India, Iraq, Israel,\nPakistan, Saudi Arabia Turkey\nUnited Arab Emirates, and the\nUSA\n\nThe documents try to mimic\ngovernment organizations,\nincluding the Iraqi National\nIntelligence Service, the National\nSecurity Agency, and the Ministry\nof Interior of Saudi Arabia\n\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Tajikistan\n\nThe documents try to mimic\ngovernment organizations such as\nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan. Some\ndocuments also come with\ngovernment emblems.\n\n\n**Dropped Files** Visual Basic file and Powershell\nfile; the VBS file executes the PS\nfile\n\n**Proxies** Hundreds of hacked websites are\nused as proxies.\n\nIn addition to the common characteristics seen above, the campaigns also use similar\nobfuscation processes, as are the internal variables after deobfuscation. A list of isDebugEnv\nis also present in both campaigns.\n\n**Infection Chain**\n\n[Figure 1. Infection chain for the attack](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig1.png)\n\nFigure 1. Infection chain for the attack\n\nOur research found malicious delivery documents (Detected by Trend Micro as\n**JS_VALYRIA.DOCT and W2KM_VALYRIA.DOCT) containing text and file names in the**\nTajik language attempting to target individuals working for government organizations and\ntelecommunication companies in Tajikistan. Each document uses social engineering to trick\npotential victims into clicking it to enable the macros and activate the payload. While some of\nthe payloads we observed were embedded inside the document itself, some of the payloads\nwere also downloaded from the internet after the lure was clicked.There is a separate lure\nwith a program key generator written in Java that was bundled with a Java downloader.\nHowever, the actual payload is the same.\n\nSome examples of the lure documents used in the campaign can be seen below:\n\nFigure 2. A sample document used in the campaign. Note that it uses the Tajikistan\n[emblem, signifying that this is likely used to target government organizations or make it seem](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig2.png)\nthat it came from one\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.

A second lure document that we found being used in the campaign designed to\nlook like a document sent to telecommunication companies regarding dissatisfaction with\ntheir service; it also asks them to fill out a form, which can be seen in the table at the bottom\n\nFigure 4. Another example of a header allegedly from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of\nTajikistan\n\nFigure 4. Another example of a header allegedly from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of\nTajikistan\n\nAfter enabling the macros and the payload executes, two files – an obfuscated Visual Basic\nscript (Detected by Trend Micro as VBS_VALYRIA.DOCT), and an obfuscated PowerShell\nscript (Detected by Trend Mico as TROJ_VALYRIA.PS) — are created in the ProgramData\ndirectory placed in randomly-named directories. The purpose of the .VBS script is to execute\nthe PowerShell script. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of\npersistence.\n\n[Figure 5. The installed backdoor and persistence script](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig5.png)\n\nFigure 5. The installed backdoor and persistence script\n\nIn other campaigns, two files are also dropped. One of them is the VBS script, however, the\nsecond file is a base64 encoded text file, which, after decoding, results in the Powershell file,\nas in the previous campaign. This is one simple layer of obfuscation, likely to avoid some\nantivirus detections.\n\nThe latest change, drops three files – an.sct scriptlet file, an.inf file and a base64 encoded\ndata file. The scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing\napplockerCode examples are also available on github.\n\nThe PowerShell script, which employs several layers of obfuscation, is divided into three\nparts. Part one contains global variables like paths, encryption keys, a list of a few hundred\ngates or hacked websites which serve as proxies:\n\n[Figure 6. The configuration portion of the PowerShell script](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig6.png)\n\nFigure 6. The configuration portion of the PowerShell script\n\nThe second part contains functions related to the encryption, which is a standard RSA\nencryption with very small keys.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third part contains the backdoor function. This function will first collect machine\ninformation and take screenshots before it sends this data to a command-and-control (C&C)\nserver while waiting for commands. These include the following actions: clean, reboot,\nshutdown, screenshot, and upload.\n\nThe clean command attempts to recursively delete all the items from drives C, D, E, and F.\n\n[Figure 7. The clean command wipes drives C, D, E and F](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig7.png)\n\nFigure 7. The clean command wipes drives C, D, E and F\n\n**C&C Communication**\n\nThe communication is done via XML messages with the following supported ACTION\ncommands:\n\nREGISTER\nIMAGE\nCOMMAND RESULT\nUPLOAD\n\nThe backdoor first finds out the machine IP address by querying the internet service\napi[.]ipify[.]org, which returns the IP address of the currently infected machine. This IP\naddress is then fed to another internet service called apinotes[.]com, which returns the\nlocation information of the given IP address.\n\nThe backdoor then collects the system information about the infected machine such as the\nOperating System name, architecture, domain, network adapter configuration, and\nusername. It then separates each piece of information with **, and sends this system info as\npart of the REGISTER message:\n\n[Figure 8. The register message before encryption](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig8.png)\n\nFigure 8. The register message before encryption\n\nA simple RSA algorithm with very small keys encrypts the message seen above. Let’s take\nthe first character as an example. Character “{” = 0x7B =123. Variable ${prIVATE} = 959, 713\nfrom section 1 of the PowerShell script has two values; the first number is the key and the\nsecond number is the modulus. By computing (123 ^ 959) mod 713 = 340 we get the\nencrypted value of the first character (see number 340 in the figure below). The message\nabove gets encrypted as shown in figure 9 below, then its contents are sent via post request\nto one of many hacked gates.\n\n[Figure 9. The register message after encryption](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig9.png)\n\nFigure 9. The register message after encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nThe response to this message is another set of decimal numbers which can be decrypted by\nthe public key, which is stored in ${pUbLIC} = 37, 437 variable in part 1 of the PowerShell\nscript.\n\n[Figure 10. The encrypted response to the register message](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig10.png)\n\nFigure 10. The encrypted response to the register message\n\nThe message above can be decrypted to:\n\n_{\"STATUS\": \"OK\", \"TOKEN\": \"d02153ffaf8137b1fa3bb852a27a12f8\"}_\n\nThe XML message containing screenshot can be seen below. Note that the previously\nobtained SYSID that serves as a machine identifier, ACTION:”IMAGE” tells us that a base64\nencoded image will be followed in IMAGE field.\n\n[Figure 11. The XML message with the screenshot](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig11.png)\n\nFigure 11. The XML message with the screenshot\n\nIt seems that the attackers are actively monitoring the incoming connections to the C&C. In\none of our attempts, we sent an improper request to the C&C server, which replied with the\nfollowing message: “Stop!!! I Kill You Researcher.” This level of personalized messaging\nimplies that the attackers are monitoring what data is going to and from their C&C server.\n\n[Figure 12. When the threat actor discovers the researcher via an improper request](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/03/MWFig12.png)\n\nFigure 12. When the threat actor discovers the researcher via an improper request\n\n**Another hidden message or a false flag?**\n\nFor the PowerShell script, the first part contains a variable named dragon_middle, which is\nan array containing a few hundred URLs ending with connection.php that serve as proxies\nbetween victim and C&C. If communication with C&C fails, and if the PowerShell script is run\nfrom a command line, a few error messages written in simplified Mandarin Chinese are\ndisplayed, with a curious phrase that translates to \"waiting for dragon\":\n\n无法访问本地计算机寄存器 (Unable to access local computer register)\n任务计划程序访问被拒绝 (Mission Scheduler access is denied)\n无法连接到网址，请等待龙 (Cannot connect to URL, please wait for dragon)\n无法连接到网址，请等待龙 (Cannot connect to website, please wait for dragon)\n\nThese messages may not reveal anything about the real attackers as the malware writers\nsometimes like to embed false flags into their programs to confuse researchers. The syntax\nand grammar suggest that the language could have been machine-translated rather than\nwritten by a native speaker.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Countermeasures and Trend Micro Solutions**\n\nUsers unfamiliar with the various kinds of social engineering techniques might find it difficult\nto distinguish a legitimate message from a malicious one – thus the need for education on\n[identifying and mitigating phishing attacks – especially if it involves organizations in sensitive](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/best-practices-identifying-and-mitigating-phishing-attacks)\nindustries such as government and manufacturing.
