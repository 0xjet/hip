According to MalwareHunterTeam, the [ID-Ransomware service has only seen](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)\ntwo submissions in the last 30 days, suggesting the project has been abandoned or is seeing\nlesser use in favor of its native version – with natively-coded ransomware being known to be\nfaster at encrypting files compared to .NET alternatives.\n\n## Paradise ransomware builder leaked\n\nThe Paradise code that was leaked over the weekend is the source code for the .NET\nversion of the Paradise ransomware, and more precisely for its builder and decryption utility,\nMalka and Blaze told The Record today.\n\nImage: The Record\n\nImage: Bart Blaze (supplied)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage:\n\n\nBart Blaze (supplied)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Bart Blaze (supplied)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Bart Blaze (supplied)\nThe leak of the Paradise ransomware builder is a legitimate cause for concern, even if it’s for\nthe lesser-used .NET version.\n\nSample Paradise ransomware strains built by Blaze earlier today were classified as\nundecryptable when uploaded and verified via the ID-Ransomware service.\n\n[With the source code readily available in the public domain, and known to be undecryptable,](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1202936203290525701)\nwe cannot exclude that some threat actors will jump on the opportunity to use it, even if it’s\nnot as refined as the native version of the Paradise RaaS.\n\nTags\n\n[hacking forum](https://therecord.media/tag/hacking-forum/)\n[leak](https://therecord.media/tag/leak/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[Paradise](https://therecord.media/tag/paradise/)\n[RaaS](https://therecord.media/tag/raas/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[source code](https://therecord.media/tag/source-code/)\n[XSS](https://therecord.media/tag/xss/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
