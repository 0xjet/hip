To provide more insights into the role of cyber, today, we are\nreleasing our report Fog of War: How the Ukraine Conflict Transformed the Cyber Threat\nLandscape based on analysis from Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Mandiant and\nTrust & Safety. The report encompasses new findings, and retrospective insights, across\ngovernment-backed attackers, information operations (IO) and cybercriminal ecosystem\nthreat actors. It also includes threat actor deep dives focused on specific campaigns from\n2022.\n\n## Coming together to support Ukraine\n\nSince the war began, governments, companies, civil society groups and countless others\nhave been working around the clock to support the Ukrainian people and their institutions. At\nGoogle, we [support these efforts and continue to announce new commitments and support](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/new-ways-were-supporting-ukraine/)\n[to Ukraine. This includes a donation of 50,000 Google Workspace licenses for the](https://workspace.google.com/lp/business/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-dr-1011401&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_595115551801-ADGP_Desk%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20EXA%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20Google%20Workspace%20~%20Core_Google%20Workspace%20Core-KWID_43700060153385061-kwd-346911454270&utm_term=KW_google%20workspace-ST_google%20workspace&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsdKbBhDHARIsANJ6-jeA97mh-jQiR8NtHEy9l9g__OXHUPdf3u2d-0u5en-sLQE8waGCSq8aAuOaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment; [rapid Air Raid Alerts system for Android phones in the region;](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ukrainealarm) support for\n[refugees, businesses, and entrepreneurs; and measures to indefinitely pause monetization](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/helping-ukraine/)\nand limit the reach of Russian state news media.\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges, however, is that the Ukrainian government is under\nnear-constant digital attack. Shortly after the invasion, we expanded eligibility for Project\nShield, our free protection against distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), so that\nUkrainian government websites and embassies worldwide could stay online and continue to\noffer critical services.\n\nWe continue to provide direct assistance to the Ukrainian government and critical\n[infrastructure entities under the Cyber Defense Assistance Collaborative — including](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crdf-global-becomes-platform-for-cyber-defense-assistance-collaborative-cdac-for-ukraine-301676373.html)\ncompromise assessments, incident response services, shared cyber threat intelligence, and\nsecurity transformation services — to help detect, mitigate and defend against cyber attacks.\n[In addition, we continue to implement protections for users and track and disrupt cyber](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-threat-landscape-ukraine/)\nthreats to help raise awareness among the security community and high-risk users and\nmaintain information quality.\n\nThis level of collective defense – between governments, companies and security\nstakeholders across the world – is unprecedented in scope. We wanted to share what we\nhave learned with the global security community to help prepare better defenses for the\nfuture.\n\n## Key findings\n\n**1. Russian government-backed attackers have engaged in an aggressive, multi-**\n**pronged effort to gain a decisive wartime advantage in cyberspace, often with mixed**\n**results.**\n\nThis includes a significant shift in various groups’ focus towards Ukraine, a dramatic increase\nin the use of destructive attacks on Ukrainian government, military and civilian infrastructure,\na spike in spear-phishing activity targeting NATO countries, and an uptick in cyber operations\ndesigned to further multiple Russian objectives. For example, we’ve observed threat actors\nhack-and-leak sensitive information to further a specific narrative.\n\nchart showing phishing activity by state sponsored actors\nRussian government-backed attackers ramped up cyber operations beginning in 2021 during\nthe run up to the invasion. In 2022, Russia increased targeting of users in Ukraine by 250%\ncompared to 2020. Targeting of users in NATO countries increased over 300% in the same\nperiod.\n\ncharts showing the top phishing target domains\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2022, Russian government-backed attackers targeted users in Ukraine more than any\nother country. While we see these attackers focus heavily on Ukrainian government and\nmilitary entities, the campaigns we disrupted also show a strong focus on critical\ninfrastructure, utilities and public services, and the media and information space.\n\nchart showing the five phases of Russian cyber operations during the war in Ukraine in\n2022\nFrom its incident response work, Mandiant observed more destructive cyber attacks in\nUkraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years with attacks\npeaking around the start of the invasion. While they saw significant activity after that period,\nthe pace of attacks slowed and appeared less coordinated than the initial wave in February\n2022. Specifically, destructive attacks often occurred more quickly after the attacker gained\nor regained access, often through compromised edge infrastructure. Many operations\nindicated an attempt by the Russian Armed Forces’ Main Directorate of the General Staff\n(GRU) to balance competing priorities of access, collection, and disruption throughout each\nphase of activity.\n\n**2. Moscow has leveraged the full spectrum of IO – from overt state-backed media to**\n**covert platforms and accounts – to shape public perception of the war.**\n\nThese operations have three goals:\n\n1. Undermine the Ukrainian government\n2. Fracture international support for Ukraine\n3. Maintain domestic support in Russia for the war\n\nWe’ve seen spikes of activity associated with key events in the conflict such as the buildup,\ninvasion and troop mobilization in Russia. At Google, we’ve worked aggressively across\nproducts, teams and regions to counter these activities where they violate our policies and\ndisrupt overt and covert IO campaigns, but continue to encounter relentless attempts to\ncircumvent our policies.\n\nillustration of the instances of Russion IO activity disrupted by Google on our platforms in\n2022\nThe covert Russian IO we’ve disrupted on Google product surfaces primarily focused on\nmaintaining Russian domestic support for the war in Ukraine, with over 90% of the instances\nin the Russian language.\n\n**3. The invasion has triggered a notable shift in the Eastern European cybercriminal**\n**ecosystem that will likely have long term implications for both coordination between**\n**criminal groups and the scale of cybercrime worldwide.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSome groups have split over political allegiances and geopolitics, while others have lost\nprominent operators, which will impact the way we think about these groups and our\ntraditional understanding of their capabilities. We’ve also seen a trend towards specialization\nin the ransomware ecosystem that blends tactics across actors, making definitive attribution\nmore difficult. The war in Ukraine has also been defined by what we expected but didn’t see.\nFor example, we didn’t observe a surge of attacks against critical infrastructure outside of\nUkraine.\n\nTAG also sees tactics closely associated with financially motivated threat actors being\ndeployed in campaigns with targets typically associated with government-backed attackers.\nIn September 2022, TAG reported on [a threat actor whose activities overlap with CERT-UA’s](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/initial-access-broker-repurposing-techniques-in-targeted-attacks-against-ukraine/)\n[UAC-0098, a threat actor that historically delivered the IcedID banking trojan, leading to](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39609)\nhuman-operated ransomware attacks. We assess some members of UAC-0098 are former\nConti members repurposing their techniques to target Ukraine.\n\nchart showing UAC-0098 phishing campaigns targeting Ukraine\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe assess with high confidence that Russian government-backed attackers will\ncontinue to conduct cyber attacks against Ukraine and NATO partners to further\nRussian strategic objectives.\nWe assess with high confidence that Moscow will increase disruptive and destructive\nattacks in response to developments on the battlefield that fundamentally shift the\nbalance – real or perceived – towards Ukraine (e.g., troop losses, new foreign\ncommitments to provide political or military support, etc.). These attacks will primarily\ntarget Ukraine, but increasingly expand to include NATO partners.\nWe assess with moderate confidence that Russia will continue to increase the pace\nand scope of IO to achieve the objectives described above, particularly as we approach\nkey moments like international funding, military aid, domestic referendums, and more.\nWhat’s less clear is whether these activities will achieve the desired impact, or simply\nharden opposition against Russian aggression over time.\n\nIt is clear cyber will continue to play an integral role in future armed conflict, supplementing\ntraditional forms of warfare, and hope this report serves as a call to action as we prepare for\nwhat lies ahead. At Google, we are committed to doing our part to support collective defense\nand look forward to partnering with others to drive continued progress and help\norganizations, businesses, governments and users stay safe online.\n\n_Click_ _[here for the full report, and security practitioners interested in the webinar can sign up](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_fog_of_war_research_report.pdf)_\n_[here.](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18282/574951?utm_source=GoogleCloudSecurity&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=574951)_\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
