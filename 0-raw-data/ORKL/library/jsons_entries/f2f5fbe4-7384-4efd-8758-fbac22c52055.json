Bennett\n\nFeb 19, 2014\n\n11 mins read\n\nThreat Actors\n\nRather than building custom malware, many threat actors behind targeted attacks use publicly or\ncommercially available remote access Trojans (RATs). This pre-built malware has all the\nfunctionality needed to conduct cyber espionage and is controlled directly by humans, who have\nthe ability to adapt to network defenses. As a result, the threat posed by these RATs should not\nbe underestimated.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, it is difficult to distinguish and correlate the activity of targeted threat actors based\nsolely on their preference to use particular malware — especially, freely available malware. From\nan analyst’s perspective, it is unclear whether these actors choose to use this type of malware\nsimply out of convenience or in a deliberate effort to blend in with traditional cybercrime groups,\nwho also use these same tools.\n\nThere are numerous RATs available for free and for purchase in online forums, chat rooms and\nmarket places on the Internet. Most RATs are easy to use and thus attract novices. They are\nused for a variety of criminal activity, including “sextortion”. [1] The ubiquity of these RATs makes\nit difficult to determine if a particular security incident is related to a targeted threat, cybercrime\nor just a novice “script kiddie” causing a nuisance.\n\nAlthough publicly available RATs are used by a variety of operators with different intents, the\nactivity of particular threat actors can still be tracked by clustering command and control server\ninformation as well as the information that is set by the operators in the builder. These technical\nindicators, combined with context of an incident (such as the timing, specificity and human\nactivity) allow analysts to assess the targeted or non-targeted nature of the threat.\n\nIn this post, we examine a publicly available RAT known as XtremeRAT. This malware has been\nused in targeted attacks as well as traditional cybercrime. During our investigation we found that\nthe majority of XtremeRAT activity is associated with spam campaigns that typically distribute\nZeus variants and other banking-focused malware. Why have these traditional cybercrime\noperators begun to distribute RATs? This seems odd, considering RATs require manual labor as\nopposed to automated banking Trojans.\n\nBased on our observations we propose one or more of the following possible explanations:\n\n1. Smokescreen\n\nThe operations may be part of a targeted attack that seeks to disguise itself and its\npossible targets, by using spam services to launch the attacks.\n2. Less traditional tools available\n\nWith more crimeware author arrests and/or disappearance of a number of banking Trojan\ndevelopers, cybercriminals are resorting to using RATs to manually steal data, such as\nbanking and credit card details. [2]\n3. Complicated defenses require more versatile tools\n\nAs many traditional banking and financial institutions have improved their security\npractices, perhaps attackers have had a much more difficult time developing automation in\ntheir Trojans to cover all variations of these defenses; as such, RATs provide more\nversatility and effectiveness, at the expense of scalability.\n4. Casting a wider net\n\nAfter compromising indiscriminate targets, attackers may dig deeper into specific targets of\ninterest and/or sell off the access rights of the victims’ systems and their data to others.\n\nThese possible explanations are not mutually exclusive. One or all of them may be factors in\nexplaining this observed activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**XtremeRAT**\n\nThe XtremeRAT was developed by “xtremecoder” and has been available since at least 2010.\nWritten in Delphi, the code of XtremeRAT is shared amongst several other Delphi RAT projects\nincluding SpyNet, CyberGate, and Cerberus. The RAT is available for free; however, the\ndeveloper charges 350 Euros for the source code. Unfortunately for xtremecoder, the source\ncode has been leaked online. The current version is Xtreme 3.6, however, there are a variety of\n“private” version of this RAT available as well. As such, the official version of this RAT and its\nmany variants are used by a wide variety of actors.\n\nXtremeRAT allows an attacker to:\n\nInteract with the victim via a remote shell\nUpload/download files\nInteract with the registry\nManipulate running processes and services\nCapture images of the desktop\nRecord from connected devices, such as a webcam or microphone\n\nMoreover, during the build process, the attacker can specify whether to include keylogging and\nUSB infection functions.\n\n**Extracting Intelligence**\n\nXtremeRAT contains two components: a “client” and a “server”; however, from the attacker’s\nperspective, these terms have reversed meanings. Specifically, according to the author, the\n“server” component is the malware that resides on victim endpoints that connect to the “client”,\nwhich is operated by the attacker from one or more remote command-and-control (CnC)\nsystems. Due to this confusing and overloaded terminology, we refer to the “server” as a\n“backdoor” on the victim and the “client” as a remote “controller” operated by the attacker.\n\nXtremeRAT backdoors maintain and reference configuration data that was chosen by the\nattacker at the time they were built. This data can contain very useful hints to help group attacks\nand attribute them to actors, similar to what we have previously described in our Poison Ivy\nwhitepaper. [3]\n\nSeveral versions of XtremeRAT write this configuration data to disk under\n```\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows, either directly, or to a directory named after mutex\n\n```\nconfigured by the attacker. When written to disk, the data is RC4 encrypted with a key of either\n\"CYBERGATEPASS\" or \"CONFIG\" for the versions we have analyzed. In both cases, the key is\nUnicode. The config file has either a “.nfo” or \".cfg\" extension depending on the version.\nXtremeRAT's key scheduling algorithm (KSA) implementation contains a bug wherein it only\nconsiders the length of the key string, not including the null bytes between each character, as is\nfound in these Unicode strings. As a result, it only effectively uses the first half of the key. For\n\n\n-----\n\nexample, the key `C\\x00O\\x00N\\x00F\\x00I\\x00G\\x00 is 12 bytes long, but the length is`\ncalculated as only being 6 bytes long. Because of this, the key that is ultimately used is\n“ C\\x00O\\x00N\\x00 ”.\n\nThe configuration data includes:\n\nName of the installed backdoor file\nDirectory under which the backdoor file is installed\nWhich process it will inject into (if specified)\nCnC information\nFTP information for sending stolen keystroke data to\nMutex name of the master process,\nID and group name which are used by the actors for organizational purposes\n\nBecause the decrypted configuration data can be reliably located in memory (with only slight\nvariations in its structure from version to version) and because not all versions of XtremeRAT will\nwrite their configuration data to disk, parsing memory dumps of infected systems is often the\nideal method for extracting intelligence.\n\nWe are releasing python scripts we have developed to gather the configuration details for\nvarious versions of XtremeRAT from both process memory dumps and the encrypted\n[configuration file on disk. The scripts are available here.](https://github.com/fireeye/tools/tree/master/malware/Xtreme%20RAT)\n\nAlso included in this toolset is a script that decrypts and prints the contents of the log file created\nby XtremeRAT containing victim keystroke data. This log file is written to the same directory as\nthe config file and has a “.dat” extension. Curiously, this log file is encrypted with a simple twobyte XOR instead of RC4. Later in this blog, we will share some of the configuration details we\nhave extracted during our subsequent analysis.\n\n**XtremeRAT Activity**\n\nUsing telemetry from the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud, we examined 165\nXtremeRAT samples from attacks that primarily hit the following sectors:\n\nEnergy, utilities, and petroleum refining\nFinancial Services\nHigh-tech\n\nThese incidents include a spectrum of attacks including targeted attacks as well as\nindiscriminate attacks. Among these XtremeRAT-based attacks, we found that 4 of the 165\nsamples were used in targeted attacks against the High-Tech sector by threat actors we have\ncalled “MoleRats”. [4]\n\n**Operation Molerats**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2012, XtremeRAT was used against a variety of governments as well as Israeli and\nPalestinian targets in what was known as Operation Molerats (the same attackers have also\nused variants of the Poison Ivy RAT). [5] Upon executing one particular sample\n(45142b17abd8a17a5e38305b718f3415), the malware beacons to “test.cable-modem.org” and\n“idf.blogsite.org”. In this particular case, the attacker used XtremeRAT 2.9 within a self-extracting\narchive that also presents a decoy document to the victim, where the decoy content appears to\nhave been copied from a website.\n\n\nContents of SFX archive containing XtremeRAT\n\n\nFigure\n\n\n1: Contents of SFX archive containing XtremeRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nSFX settings inside malicious archive\n\n\nFigure 2:\n\n\nSFX settings inside malicious archive\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy content presented in malicious archive\n\n\nFigure 3:\n\nDecoy content presented in malicious archive\nFigure 4 shows the controller the attacker uses to interact with systems compromised with\nXtremeRAT. In this case, it appears the actor used the ID field to record the type of attack\ndelivered (docx) and the Group field was used to record a “campaign code” (IDF), which helps\nthe actor keep track of the set of victims that were attacked during this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: XtremeRAT controller GUI\n\n\nFigure 4:\n\nXtremeRAT controller GUI\nThe attacker modified the highlighted information at build time. By default, the XtremeRAT\ncontroller sets the ID field as “Server” and Group field as “Servers”, with the default password\nused to authenticate, connect, and control a compromised endpoint as “1234567890”.\n\n\n-----\n\nXtremeRAT controller connection settings\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\nXtremeRAT controller connection settings\nIn the Figure 5, the attacker specified custom CnC servers and ports and changed the default\npassword to “1411”. The attacker also changed the default process mutex name.\n\n\n-----\n\nXtremeRat install settings\n\n\nFigure 6:\n\nXtremeRat install settings\nBy default, the controller assigns a process mutex name of is “--((Mutex))--” and the attackers\nchanged it to “fdgdfdg”. These indicators along with command and control domain names and\nthe IP addresses that they resolve to can be used to cluster and track this activity over time.\n\n\n-----\n\nMolerats cluster analysis\n\n\nFigure 7:\n\nMolerats cluster analysis\nThis is a cluster of Molerats activity. In addition to using the password “1411”, the attackers are\nalso using the password “12345000”. This is a simple way to track the activity of these actors by\nusing both passive DNS data and configuration information extracted from XtremeRAT.\n\n**Spam Activity**\n\nThe vast majority of XtremeRAT activity clustered around the default password “1234567890”\n(116 samples). There was overlap between this large cluster and the second largest one which\nused the password “123456” (12 samples). The activity in these two clusters aligns with\nindicators observed in Spanish language spam runs. The “123456” cluster also contains spam in\nthe English language, leveraging the recent tragedy in Kenya as a lure. [7]\n\n**The Uranio Cluster**\n\nIn our sample set, we have 28 malware samples that connect to a set of sequentially numbered\ncommand and control servers:\n\n\n-----\n\nuranio.no-ip.biz\nuranio2.no-ip.biz\nuranio3.no-ip.biz\nuranio4.no-ip.biz\nuranio5.no-ip.biz\nuranio6.no-ip.biz\nuranio7.no-ip.biz\nplatino.no-ip.biz\nplatino-2.no-ip.biz\nplatino-4.no-ip.biz\nplatino-5.no-ip.biz\nplatino-8.no-ip.biz\nplatino-9.no-ip.biz\ncometa3.no-ip.biz\ncometa4.no-ip.biz\n\nThe malware is being spammed out and has file names such as:\n\nCertificaciones De Pagos Nominas Parafiscales jpg 125420215 58644745574455 .exe\nSoportes de pagos certificaciones y documentos mes mayo 30 2013\n567888885432235678888888123456.exe\nCertificaciones De Pago Y Para Fiscales.exe\n\nWe extracted the configurations for a sampling of the XtremeRAT samples we came across in\nthis spam run and found the following results:\n\n**MD5** **ID** **Group** **Version**

During that\ntime, 12000 unique IPs connected to the uranio2.no-ip.biz. Recall, that this number reflects only\none of many command and control servers. [8]\n\nHowever, estimating the number of victims this way is difficult due to DHCP lease times, which\ninflate the numbers, and NAT connections, which deflate the numbers. [9] As such, we counted\nthe unique IP addresses that connected to the sinkhole on each day. The highest number of\n\n\n-----\n\nconnections to this sinkhole was on Dec. 3, 2013 with 2003 connections and the lowest was Jan.\n6, 2014 with 109 connections. The average number of unique IP addresses that connected to\nthe sinkhole per day was 657.\n\nWhile these IP addresses were in ranges assigned to 40 distinct countries, the vast majority of\nthe connections to the sinkhole (92.7 percent) were from Colombia. Argentina was a distant\nsecond with 1.22 percent, followed by Venezuela with 1.02 percent, Egypt with 0.95 percent and\nthe U.S. with 0.9 percent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDetermining the activity of targeted threat actors is difficult. Most of the activity associated with\npublicly available RATs is traditional cybercrime associated with spam runs, banking Trojans and\nmalware distribution. However, useful indicators can be extracted from these ubiquitous RATs to\ntrack the activities of targeted threat actors (as well as cybercrime).\n\n**Tools**\n\n[Xtreme RAT](https://github.com/fireeye/tools/tree/master/malware/Xtreme%20RAT)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/miss-teen-usas-webcam-spy-called-himselfcutefuzzypuppy/ http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/09/how-an-omniscient-internetsextortionist-ruined-lives/\n\n2.
