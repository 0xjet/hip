The websites promised\nto render malicious software fully undetectable by nearly every major provider of antivirus\nsoftware. Koshkin and his co-conspirators claimed that their services could be used for\nmalware such as botnets, remote-access trojans, keyloggers, credential stealers and\ncryptocurrency miners.\n\n“The defendant designed and operated a service that was an essential tool for some of the\nworld’s most destructive cybercriminals, including ransomware attackers,” said Acting\nAssistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department's Criminal\nDivision. “The verdict should serve as a warning to those who provide infrastructure to\n\n\n-----\n\ncybercriminals: the Criminal Division and our law enforcement partners consider you to be\njust as culpable as the hackers whose crimes you enable — and we will work tirelessly to\nbring you to justice.”\n\nIn particular, Koshkin worked with Peter Levashov, the operator of the Kelihos botnet, to\ndevelop a system that would allow Levashov to crypt the Kelihos malware multiple times\neach day. Koshkin provided Levashov with a custom, high-volume crypting service that\nenabled Levashov to distribute Kelihos through multiple criminal affiliates. Levashov used the\nKelihos botnet to send spam, harvest account credentials, conduct denial of service attacks,\nand distribute ransomware and other malicious software. At the time it was dismantled by the\nFBI, the Kelihos botnet was known to include at least 50,000 compromised computers\naround the world.\n\n“By operating a website that was intended to hide malware from antivirus programs, Koshkin\nprovided a critical service that enabled other cyber criminals to infect thousands of\ncomputers around the world,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Leonard C. Boyle for the District of\nConnecticut. “We will investigate and prosecute the individuals who aid and abet cyber\ncriminals as vigorously as we do the ones who actually hit the ‘send’ button on viruses and\nother malicious software.”\n\n“Koshkin and his associates knowingly provided crypting services designed to help malicious\nsoftware bypass anti-virus software,” said Special Agent in Charge David Sundberg of the\nFBI’s New Haven Division. “The criminal nature of the Crypt4U service was a clear threat to\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems everywhere. We at the FBI\nwill never stop pursuing those like Koshkin for perpetrating cyber crimes and threats to the\npublic at large.”\n\nKoshkin was arrested in California in September 2019 and has been detained since his\narrest. He faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced\non Sept. 20.\n\nKoshkin’s co-defendant, Pavel Tsurkan, is charged with conspiring to cause damage to 10 or\nmore protected computers, and aiding and abetting Levashov in causing damage to 10 or\nmore protected computers.\n\nLevashov was arrested by the Spanish National Police in April 2017 and extradited to the\nUnited States. In September 2018, he pleaded guilty to one count of causing intentional\ndamage to a protected computer, one count of conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, and one\ncount of aggravated identity theft.\n\nThe FBI’s New Haven Division investigated the case through its Connecticut Cyber Task\nForce.\n\n\n-----\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Edward Chang of District of Connecticut, and Senior Counsel Ryan\nK.J. Dickey of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are\nprosecuting the case with assistance from the Criminal Division’s Office of International\nAffairs. The Estonian Police and Border Guard Board also provided significant assistance.\n\nThis case is part of the Department of Justice’s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task\nForce, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion\nattacks. As part of the Task Force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys’\nOffices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital\nextortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware,\nidentifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their\ncrimes. The department, through the Task Force, also strategically targets the ransomware\ncriminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government\nagencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.\n\n\n-----",
