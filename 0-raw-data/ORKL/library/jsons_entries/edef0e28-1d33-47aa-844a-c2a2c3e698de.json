Below is a short summary of LiquorBot's features:\n\nUses the following exploits to infect routers and smart devices (mostly routers): CVE-2015-2051, CVE-2016-1555, CVE-2016-6277,\nCVE-2018-17173, CVE-2017-6884, CVE-2018-10562, CVE-2017-6077, CVE-2017-6334, CVE-2016-5679, CVE-2018-9285, CVE-20133568, CVE-2019-12780\nUses a list of 82 username-password combinations to brute-force the SSH service of smart devices on which the default password has\nnot been changed\nCan infect devices running on CPU architectures like ARM, ARM64, x86, x64, and MIPS\nIs controlled from a web-based command and control (C&C) server\n\nAbout the only novel detail about LiquorBot is the fact that the malware is a version of the Mirai strain rewritten in the Go programming\nlanguage -- but that's about it.\n\n### Wasting its time\n\nMost IoT botnets today usually appear and disappear within weeks or months. LiquorBot is a strange case because it remained active\nthroughout all 2019.\n\nBitdefender says the malware often received updates, usually in the form of new exploits. The most interesting update was, however, recorded\nin October.\n\nThe company says the LiquorBot code was expanded with a module that attempted to mine the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency on infected\ndevices.\n\nThe module, in itself, is quite useless, seeing that the entire botnet is predicated on infected routers, above anything else.\n\nSOHO (Small Office Home Office) routers are cheap devices that lack the CPU and hardware capabilities to adequately mine cryptocurrency -which is a very resource-heavy operation.\n\nIn the past, other IoT botnets have also wasted their time attempting to mine cryptocurrency on SOHO routers, with little success, and with all\ndropping any attempts within weeks, primarily due to the low yield the hacked devices were turning in.\n\n[The first IoT botnet to experiment with the feature was a Mirai-based botnet operated out of China, back in March 2017. The botnet experiment](https://securityintelligence.com/mirai-iot-botnet-mining-for-bitcoins/)\nwith a Bitcoin-mining module for a week, before dropping the module altogether.\n\n[The second was an IoT malware strain named Linux.MulDrop.14, detected by Dr.Web in June 2017. This botnet targeted Raspberry Pi](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?_is=1&i=15389228)\ndevices, where it also attempted to mine Bitcoin. While Raspberry Pi devices have access to more hardware resources than your casual\nSOHO router, this botnet didn't break the bank either, stopping its experiments after a few weeks.\n\nThe discovery of these two botnets in 2017 encouraged researchers to look into the possibility of IoT botnets of being used as cryptocurrency\nmining farms. At the time, Errata Security estimated that if a Mirai botnet of 2.5 million bots mined cryptocurrency it would earn only a meager\n$0.25 per day, effectively dispelling the notion that IoT botnets could ever be used for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nApparently, the LiquorBot author didn't get the notice.\n\n**The most shocking of Shodan**\n\n\n-----",
