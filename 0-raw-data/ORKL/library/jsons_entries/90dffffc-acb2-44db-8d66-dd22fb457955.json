Blanco of the Department of Justice’s Criminal\nDivision, Acting U.S. Attorney Gregory G. Brooker of the District of Minnesota and Assistant\nDirector Scott Smith of the FBI’s Cyber Division made the announcement.\n\nMaxim Senakh, 41, of Velikii Novgorod, Russia, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to violate\nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and to commit wire fraud before U.S. District Judge\nPatrick J. Schlitz of the District of Minnesota. Sentencing is set for Aug. 3, 2017. Senakh\nwas indicted on Jan. 13, 2015, and was subsequently arrested by Finnish authorities, who\nextradited him to the United States.\n\nAccording to admissions made in connection with the plea agreement, the malware, which is\nknown as Ebury, harvested log-on credentials from infected computer servers, allowing\nSenakh and his co-conspirators to create and operate a botnet comprising tens of thousands\nof infected servers throughout the world, including thousands in the United States. Senakh\n\n\n-----\n\nand his co-conspirators used the Ebury botnet to generate and redirect internet traffic in\nfurtherance of various click-fraud and spam e-mail schemes, which fraudulently generated\nmillions of dollars in revenue. As part of the plea, Senakh admitted that he supported the\ncriminal enterprise by creating accounts with domain registrars which helped build the Ebury\nbotnet infrastructure and personally profited from traffic generated by the Ebury botnet.\n\nThe FBI Minneapolis Field Office is investigating the case.
