CrowdStrike and another firm have\nbeen supporting SolarWinds in its investigation and root cause analysis of the events that led to the inclusion of unauthorized malicious\n[code into its build cycle. In coordination with SolarWinds, which has posted a blog detailing its efforts to ensure the security of its](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst)\ncustomers and build processes, CrowdStrike is providing a technical analysis of a malicious tool that was deployed into the build\nenvironment to inject this backdoor into the SolarWinds Orion platform without arousing the suspicion of the development team charged\n[with delivering the product. At this time, CrowdStrike does not attribute the SUNSPOT implant, SUNBURST backdoor or TEARDROP](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html&sa=D&ust=1610392135094000&usg=AOvVaw2PE38JjvaIWmhkzPg-HoAG)\npost-exploitation tool to any known adversary; as such, CrowdStrike Intelligence is tracking this intrusion under the StellarParticle\nactivity cluster.\n\n## Key Points\n\nSUNSPOT is StellarParticle’s malware used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into software builds of the SolarWinds Orion IT\nmanagement product.\nSUNSPOT monitors running processes for those involved in compilation of the Orion product and replaces one of the source files to\ninclude the SUNBURST backdoor code.\nSeveral safeguards were added to SUNSPOT to avoid the Orion builds from failing, potentially alerting developers to the adversary’s\npresence.\n\nAnalysis of a SolarWinds software build server provided insights into how the process was hijacked by StellarParticle in order to insert\nSUNSPOT into the update packages. The design of SUNSPOT suggests StellarParticle developers invested a lot of effort to ensure the code\nwas properly inserted and remained undetected, and prioritized operational security to avoid revealing their presence in the build\nenvironment to SolarWinds developers.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nSUNSPOT was identified on disk with a filename of `taskhostsvc.exe (SHA256 Hash:`\n```\nc45c9bda8db1d470f1fd0dcc346dc449839eb5ce9a948c70369230af0b3ef168 ), and internally named taskhostw.exe by its\n\n```\ndevelopers. It was likely built on 2020-02-20 11:40:02, according to the build timestamp found in the binary, which is consistent with the\ncurrently assessed StellarParticle supply chain attack timeline. StellarParticle operators maintained the persistence of SUNSPOT by\ncreating a scheduled task set to execute when the host boots.\n\n### Initialization and Logging\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen SUNSPOT executes, it creates a mutex named `{12d61a41 4b74 7610 a4d8 3028d2f56395} to ensure only one instance is`\nrunning. It then creates an encrypted log file at `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\vmware-vmdmp.log . Individual log entries are encrypted with the`\nstream cipher RC4, using the hard-coded key `FC F3 2A 83 E5 F6 D0 24 A6 BF CE 88 30 C2 48 E7 . Throughout execution,`\nSUNSPOT will log errors to this file, along with other deployment information. Log entries are delineated by the hex string `32 78 A5 E7`\n```\n1A 79 91 AC and begin with the number of seconds elapsed since the first log line. Most log lines corresponding to an error contain a\n\n```\nstep number (e.g., Step19) requiring knowledge of the malware to understand their meaning. These steps and their mapping to the\nmalware actions are provided at the end of this blog. The step numbering does not follow the actual execution order, suggesting the calls\nto the logging function were added by the developers during the creation of the malware as they progressed and needed to focus their\nefforts on debugging one part of the code. An extract of a log file generated by SUNSPOT in a test environment is given below.\n```\n0.000 START\n22.781[3148] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n194.343[13760] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n324.250[14696] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252] 351.125[14696] - 0\n352.031[14176] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n376.343[11864] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n439.953[9204] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252] 485.343[9204] Solution directory: C:\\Users\\User\\Source\n485.343[ERROR]\nStep4('C:\\Users\\User\\Source\\Src\\Lib\\SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer\\BackgroundInventory\\InventoryManager.cs')\nfails\n\n```\nThe malware then grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token to add `SeDebugPrivilege . This step is a`\nprerequisite for the remainder of SUNSPOT’s execution, which involves reading other processes’ memory.\n\n### Build Hijacking Steps\n\n**Monitoring of Running Software Build Processes**\n\nAfter initialization, SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of `MsBuild.exe, which is part of Microsoft Visual Studio`\ndevelopment tools. Copies of `MsBuild.exe are identified by hashing the name of each running process and comparing it to the`\ncorresponding value, `0x53D525 . The hashing algorithm used for the comparison is ElfHash and is provided in Python in Figure 1.`\n```\ndef elf_hash(name):\n  # Test input: b'msbuild.exe'\n  # Test output: 0x53D525\n  h = 0\n  for c in name:\n    v = (c + (h << 4))\n    msb = v & 0xF0000000\n    if msb != 0:\n      v ^= (msb >> 24)\n    h = ~msb & v\n  return h\n\n```\nFigure 1. Process Name Hashing Logic\n\nWhen SUNSPOT finds an `MsBuild.exe process, it will spawn a new thread to determine if the Orion software is being built and, if so,`\nhijack the build operation to inject SUNBURST. The monitoring loop executes every second, allowing SUNSPOT to modify the target\nsource code before it has been read by the compiler.\n\nAlthough the mutex created during the initialization should already prevent multiple process monitoring loops from running, the malware\nchecks for the presence of a second mutex — `{56331e4d-76a3-0390-a7ee-567adf5836b7} . If this mutex is found, the backdoor`\ninterprets it as a signal to quit, waits for the completion of its currently running backdoor injection threads, and exits. This mutex was\nlikely intended to be used by StellarParticle operators to discreetly stop the malware, instead of using a riskier method such as killing the\nprocess. Stopping SUNSPOT in the middle of its operation could result in unfinished tampering of the Orion source code, and lead to\nOrion build errors that SolarWinds developers would investigate, revealing the adversary’s presence.\n\n**Command-Line Arguments Extraction from Process Memory**\n\nThe malware extracts the command-line arguments for each running `MsBuild.exe process from the virtual memory using a`\nmethodology similar to one publicly documented .1\n\nA call to `NtQueryInformationProcess allows the adversary to obtain a pointer to the remote process’s Process Environment Block`\n(PEB), which contains a pointer to a `_RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS structure. The latter is read to get the full command line passed`\nto the `MsBuild.exe process.`\n\nThe command line is then parsed to extract individual arguments, and SUNSPOT looks for the directory path of the Orion software Visual\nStudio solution. This value is hard-coded in the binary, in an encrypted form using AES128-CBC, whose parameters are given below. The\nsame material is used for all of the blobs encrypted with AES in the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ny ( y)\n\n```\n```\niv = 81 8C 85 49 B9 00 06 78 0B E9 63 60 26 64 B2 DA\n\n```\n\nThe key and initialization vector (IV) are not unique and can be independently found in other binary samples of several popular video\ngames. It is plausible the material was chosen on purpose in order to make static detections on the values impractical.\n\n**Orion Source Code Replacement**\n\nWhen SUNSPOT finds the Orion solution file path in a running `MsBuild.exe process, it replaces a source code file in the solution`\ndirectory, with a malicious variant to inject SUNBURST while Orion is being built. While SUNSPOT supports replacing multiple files, the\nidentified copy only replaces `InventoryManager.cs .`\n\nThe malicious source code for SUNBURST, along with target file paths, are stored in AES128-CBC encrypted blobs and are protected\nusing the same key and initialization vector.\n\nAs causing build errors would very likely prompt troubleshooting actions from the Orion developers and lead to the adversary’s discovery,\nthe SUNSPOT developers included a hash verification check, likely to ensure the injected backdoored code is compatible with a known\nsource file, and also avoid replacing the file with garbage data from a failed decryption. In the exemplar SUNSPOT sample, the MD5 hash\nfor the backdoored source code is `5f40b59ee2a9ac94ddb6ab9e3bd776ca .`\n\nIf the decryption of the parameters (target file path and replacement source code) is successful and if the MD5 checks pass, SUNSPOT\nproceeds with the replacement of the source file content. The original source file is copied with a `.bk extension (e.g.,`\n```\nInventoryManager.bk ), to back up the original content. The backdoored source is written to the same filename, but with a .tmp\n\n```\nextension (e.g., `InventoryManager.tmp ), before being moved using` `MoveFileEx to the original filename ( InventoryManager.cs ).`\nAfter these steps, the source file backdoored with SUNBURST will then be compiled as part of the standard process.\n\nSUNSPOT appends an entry in the log file with the date and time of the backdoor attempt and waits for the `MsBuild.exe process to exit`\nbefore restoring the original source code and deleting the temporary `InventoryManager.bk file. If the Orion solution build is successful,`\nit is backdoored with SUNBURST.\n\n**SUNBURST Source Code**\n\nThe source code of SUNBURST was likely sanitized before being included in SUNSPOT. The use of generic variable names, pre-obfuscated\nstrings, and the lack of developer comments or disabled code is similar to what could be obtained after decompiling a backdoored Orion\nbinary, as illustrated in Figure 2, which provides a comparison between the injected source code (top) and a decompilation output\n(bottom).\n\n```\n  private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n```\n```\n  private static bool SearchConfigurations()\n\n```\n```\n  {\n\n```\n```\n    using (ManagementObjectSearcher managementObjectSearcher = new\nManagementObjectSearcher(ZipHelper.Unzip(\"C07NSU0uUdBScCvKz1UIz8wzNooPriwuSc11KcosSy0CAA==\")))\n\n```\n```\n    {\n\n```\n```\n      foreach (ManagementObject item in managementObjectSearcher.Get())\n\n```\n```\n      {\n\n```\n```\n        ulong hash =\nGetHash(Path.GetFileName(item.Properties[ZipHelper.Unzip(\"C0gsyfBLzE0FAA==\")].Value.ToString()).ToLower());\n\n```\n```\n        if (Array.IndexOf(configTimeStamps, hash) != -1)\n\n```\n```\n        {\n\n```\n```\n          return true;\n\n```\n```\n        }\n\n```\n```\n      }\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    return false;\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n```\n  // Token: 0x0600097C RID: 2428 RVA: 0x000435A4 File Offset: 0x000417A4\n\n```\n```\n  private static bool SearchConfigurations()\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n{\n\n```\n```\n    using (ManagementObjectSearcher managementObjectSearcher = new\nManagementObjectSearcher(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.ZipHelper.Unzip(\"C07NSU0uUdBScCvKz1UIz8wzNooPriwuSc11KcosSy0C\n\n```\n```\n    {\n\n```\n```\n      foreach (ManagementBaseObject managementBaseObject in managementObjectSearcher.Get())\n\n```\n```\n      {\n\n```\n```\n        ulong hash =\nOrionImprovementBusinessLayer.GetHash(Path.GetFileName(((ManagementObject)managementBaseObject).Properties[OrionImpr\n\n```\n```\n        if (Array.IndexOf<ulong>(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.configTimeStamps, hash) != -1)\n\n```\n```\n        {\n\n```\n```\n          return true;\n\n```\n```\n        }\n\n```\n```\n      }\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    return false;\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n\nFigure 2. Comparison between injected source code (top) and decompiled using DnSpy (bottom)\n\nIn order to remove compilation warnings that could be generated by the adversary’s own code — which could alert the SolarWinds\ndevelopers — StellarParticle made their edits within `#pragma warning disable and` `#pragma warning restore statements, hinting at`\nwhat parts were edited. In particular, SUNSPOT’s entry point was added to the legitimate Orion software `RefreshInternal function by`\nadding the following try/catch block:\n\ntry {  if (!OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.IsAlive) {\n\nThread th = new Thread(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Initialize)\n\n{ IsBackground = true };\n\nth.Start();\n\n}\n\n} catch (Exception) {\n\n}\n\n### Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)\n\nThe following TTPs may be used to characterize the SUNSPOT activity described in this blog:\n\nPersistence using scheduled tasks, triggered at boot time\nUse of AES128-CBC to protect the targeted source code files and the backdoored source code file in the binary\nUse of RC4 encryption with a hard-coded key to protect the log file entries\nLog entries from different executions of the malware that are separated with a hard-coded value `32 78 A5 E7 1A 79 91 AC`\nLog file creation in the system temp directory `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\vmware-vmdmp.log masquerading as a legitimate VMWare log`\nfile\nDetection of the targeted Visual Studio solution build by reading the virtual memory of `MsBuild.exe processes, looking for the`\ntargeted solution filename\nAccess to the remote process arguments made via the remote process’s PEB structure\nReplacement of source code files during the build process, before compilation, by replacing file content with another version\ncontaining SUNSPOT\nInsertion of the backdoor code within `#pragma statements disabling and restoring warnings, to prevent the backdoor code lines`\nfrom appearing in build logs\nCheck of the MD5 hashes of the original source code and of the backdoored source code to ensure the tampering will not cause build\nerrors\nAttempt to open a non-existing mutex to detect when the malware operators want the backdoor to stop execution and safely exit\n\n## Host Indicators of Attack\n\nThe tables below detail files belonging to the SUNSPOT
