There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when\ninformation security isn't handled properly.\n\nRead now\nA group of elite hackers associated with the Iranian government has been detected attacking the US private and government sector, according\nto a security alert sent by the FBI last week.\n\nWhile the alert, called a Private Industry Notification, didn't identify the hackers by name, sources have told ZDNet that the group is tracked by\nthe larger cyber-security community under codenames such as Fox Kitten or Parisite.\n\n### Iran's cyber operations \"spear tip\"\n\nA former government cyber-security analyst, now working for a private security firm, called the group as Iran's \"spear tip\" when it comes to\ncyber-attacks.\n\nHe described the group's primary task as having to provide an \"initial beachead\" to other Iranian hacking groups — such as APT33\n(Shamoon), Oilrig (APT34), or Chafer.\n\nTo reach its goals, Fox Kitten primarily operates by attacking high-end and expensive network equipment using exploits for recently disclosed\nvulnerabilities, before companies had enough time to patch devices. Due to the nature of the devices they attack, targets primarily include\nlarge private corporations and government networks.\n\nOnce the hackers gain access to a device, they install a web shell or backdoor, transforming the equipment into a gateway into the hacked\nnetwork.\n\n[According to reports published by cyber-security firms ClearSky and](https://www.clearskysec.com/fox-kitten/) [Dragos earlier this year, Fox Kitten has been using this modus operandi](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/the-state-of-threats-to-electric-entities-in-north-america/)\nsince the summer of 2019, when it began heavily targeting vulnerabilities such as:\n\nPulse Secure \"Connect\" enterprise VPNs (CVE-2019-11510)\nFortinet VPN servers running FortiOS (CVE-2018-13379)\nPalo Alto Networks \"Global Protect\" VPN servers (CVE-2019-1579)\nCitrix \"ADC\" servers and Citrix network gateways (CVE-2019-19781)\n\n### FBI warns of new attacks targeting F5 BIG-IP devices\n\nThe FBI notification sent out to the US private sector last week says the group still targets these vulnerabilities, but Fox Kitten also upgraded\n[its attack arsenal to include an exploit for CVE-2020-5902, a vulnerability disclosed in early July that impacts BIG-IP, a very popular multi-](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K52145254)\npurpose networking device manufactured by F5 Networks.\n\nThe FBI doesn't call the group by its public names, but makes references to their past attacks against Pulse Secure VPNs and Citrix gateways,\nand also warns companies that once the hackers gain access to their networks, they are very likely to provide access to other Iranian groups,\nor monetize networks that aren't useful for espionage by deploying ransomware.\n\nFBI officials also warn that this group isn't targeting any particular sector, and any company running a BIG-IP device is likely to be targeted.\n\nWhile the FBI asked US companies to patch their on-premise BIG-IP devices to prevent successful intrusions, FBI officials also shared details\nabout a typical Fox Kitten attack, so companies can deploy countermeasures and detection rules. These details are similar to what ClearSky\ndetailed in their February 2020 report.\n\n_\"Following successful compromise of the VPN server, the actors obtain legitimate credentials and establish persistence on the server through_\n_webshells. The actors conduct internal reconnaissance post-exploitation using tools such as NMAP and Angry IP scanner. The actors deploy_\n_Mimikatz to capture credentials while on the network, and Juicy Potato for privilege escalation. The actors create new users while on the_\n_network [...]\"_\n\n_The actors use several applications for command and control (C2) while exploiting victim networks, including Chisel (C2 tunnel), ngrok, Plink,_\n_and SSHNET (reverse SSH shell). When tracking suspected C2 activity, the FBI advises that C2 activity with ngrok may be with external_\n_infrastructure associated with ngrok.\"_\n\n## Two confirmed victims\n\nBut while the FBI alert doesn't say it, sources have told ZDNet that Fox Kitten attacks against BIG-IP devices have been successful.\n\nA security researcher working for a US cyber-security firm told ZDNet that the FBI sent out the PIN alert last week after agents were called to\ninvestigate two successful intrusions where Fox Kitten hackers managed to breach US companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nue to o d sc osu e ag ee e ts, t e sou ce cou d ot de t y t e t o co pa es, o cou d t ey co t ese a e t e sa e t o\n[compromises\" mentioned in a similar alert sent out by the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-206a)\nAgency (DHS CISA) on July 24.\n\nEither way, Iran's state-sponsored hacking groups aren't the only threat actors that have targeted the BIG-IP vulnerability.\n\n[Multiple hacker groups began exploiting this bug within two days after](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-trying-to-steal-admin-passwords-from-f5-big-ip-devices/) [details and proof-of-concept exploits became public, and in recent](https://www.zdnet.com/article/f5-patches-vulnerability-that-received-a-cvss-10-severity-score/)\n[weeks, an exploit for the BIG-IP bug has even been spotted part of a Mirai-based DDoS botnet.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mirai-botnet-exploit-weaponized-to-attack-iot-devices-via-cve-2020-5902/)\n\n\n-----",
