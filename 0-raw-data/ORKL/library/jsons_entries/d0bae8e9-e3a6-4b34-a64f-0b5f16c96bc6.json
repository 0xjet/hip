WADA con�rmed\n\n [https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-08/wada-con�rms\n illegal-activity-on-yuliya-stepanovas-adams-account] that some users\n\n had received illegitimate credential harvesting e-mails that look as\n\n though they came from the WADA. The domains in the alert included:\n\n wada-awa[.]org\n\n wada-arna[.]org\n\n ThreatConnect’s Research team reviewed these domains and found that\n\n the sites were recently registered and their registration and hosting\n\n information are consistent with Russian FANCY BEAR tactics, techniques,\n\n and procedures (TTPs), as shown in the diamond model below. Further,\n\n we also identi�ed another domain registered by the same individuals -\n tas-cass[.]org -- that spoofs the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s (CAS)\n\n legitimate tas-cas.org domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WADA’s alert follows news from mid-August that WADA accounts and\n\n servers had been compromised. On August 11, a group identifying\n\n themselves as Anonymous Poland (@anpoland) defaced the CAS\n\n website [http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/world-anti-doping-agency\n hackers/] and leaked data stolen from WADA and CAS servers\n\n [https://www.hackread.com/world-anti-doping-agency-site-hacked/] .\n\n On August 13, the WADA [https://www.wada\n ama.org/en/media/news/2016-08/wada-con�rms-illegal-activity-on\n yuliya-stepanovas-adams-account] and email\n\n [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/russian\n whistleblower-yuliya-stepanova-hacked-wada] accounts belonging to\n\n Yuliya Stepanova, the Russian athlete who was called “Judas\n\n [http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/sports/olympics/yuliya\n stepanova-rio-olympics.html] ” by Vladimir Putin for helping to blow the\n\n whistle on the state sponsored doping scandal, were hacked.\n\n We assess that the phishing and Stepanova’s compromise most likely\n\n are part of targeted activity by Russian actors in response to the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games in Rio de Janeiro,\n\n Brazil. Successful operations against these individuals and organizations\n\n could facilitate Russian e�orts to privately or publically intimidate them\n\n or other potential whistleblowers. At this time, we are skeptical of\n\n @anpoland’s origins but cannot determine the extent to which, if any,\n\n they are a Russian platform similar to Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.\n\n\n**W H I T E P A P E R : 6 E A S Y W A Y S T O A D V A N C E Y O U R C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y**\n**P R O G R A M [ H T T P : / / H U B S .

One of the organization’s primary\n\n responsibilities is to monitor the World Anti-Doping Code\n\n [https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/the-code] .\n\n The CAS [http://www.tas-cas.org/en/index.html] is a the highest\n\n international tribunal that was established to settle disputes related to\n\n sport through arbitration. Starting in 2016, an anti-doping division of\n\n CAS began judging doping cases at the Olympic Games, replacing the\n\n IOC disciplinary commission.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### McLaren Report and Russian Athletes Banned\n\n###### In 2014, Stepanova, a Russian track athlete, and her husband, a former\n\n employee of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, appeared in a\n\n documentary\n\n [https://presse.wdr.de/plounge/tv/das_erste/2014/12/_pdf/English\n Skript.pdf] accusing the Russian sports system of large-scale doping\n\n fraud. They indicated that Russian athletics o�cials supplied banned\n\n substances in exchange for 5% of an athlete's earnings and falsi�ed\n\n tests together with doping control o�cers.\n\n In May 2016, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov [http://www.bbc.com/news/world\n europe-36833962], the former Director of Moscow and Sochi doping\n\n control laboratories, further alleged and detailed\n\n [http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi\n olympics-2014.html?_r=2] widespread e�orts facilitated by Russian\n\n intelligence services to circumvent positive testing results for Russian\n\n athletes. The WADA then engaged Professor Richard McLaren\n\n [http://globalnews.ca/news/2831251/russian-doping-report-who-is\n richard-mclaren/] to investigate allegations of Russian state\n\n manipulation of the doping control process for Russian athletes. On July\n\n 18, the results of McLaren’s investigation were released in a report\n\n [https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-control\n process/mclaren-independent-investigations-report-into-sochi\n allegations] that included �ndings on Moscow’s involvement in\n\n circumventing the testing process, including:\n\n The State had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into\n\n a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow\n\n Laboratory be altered. The Ministry of Sport (“MofS”), Russian Anti\n Doping Agency (RUSADA) and the Russian Federal Security Service\n\n (the “FSB”) were all involved in this operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### athletes’ analytical results and sample swapping, with the active\n\n participation and assistance of the FSB; the Center of Sports\n\n Preparation of National Teams of Russia (CSP); and, both Moscow\n\n and Sochi laboratories.\n\n Following the report, the WADA recommended [https://www.wada\n ama.org/en/media/news/2016-07/wada-statement-independent\n investigation-con�rms-russian-state-manipulation-of] that all Russian\n\n Olympic and Paralympic athletes be banned from the Rio games. The\n\n IOC ultimately cleared 271 of the 389 Olympic athletes for competition\n\n and the CAS upheld the ban [http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sport\n olympics-doping-idUSKCN101108] while the International Paralympic\n\n Committee (IPC) banned the entire Russian Paralympic team from\n\n participation.\n\n#### FANCY BEAR Consistencies\n\n###### Investigating the two domains provided in the WADA alert\n\n [https://m.paralympic.org/news/wada-warns-stakeholders-phishing\n scams] -- wada-awa[.]org and wada-arna[.]org -- using SOA and WHOIS\n\n records we were able to identify that they were registered by\n\n rob_parks@mail[.]com and macie.dietrich50@mail[.]com respectively.\n\n Leveraging capabilities from our partners at DomainTools\n\n [http://www.domaintools.com/], we were able to identify that\n\n macie.dietrich50@mail[.]com had also registered one other domain -\n tas-cass[.]org -- approximately three hours before registering wada\n arna[.]org on August 8th. We found no other domains registered by\n\n rob_parks@mail[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The wada-awa[.]org and tas-cass[.]org domains are currently hosted at\n\n the same 81.95.5[.]166 (Germany) IP address with no other domains.\n\n While these domains were registered using di�erent email addresses,\n\n their hosting at the same IP with no other domains suggests they were\n\n registered by the same individual or group. The wada-arna[.]org domain\n\n is currently hosted on a dedicated server at 149.154.157[.]171 (Italy).\n\n Based on passive DNS resolutions identi�ed through PassiveTotal\n\n [https://www.passivetotal.org/] and our integration with Farsight,\n\n [https://www.farsightsecurity.com/] we were able to identify that several\n\n\n-----\n\n###### against the WADA and/or CAS:\n\n mail.wada-awa[.]org\n\n inside.wada-arna[.]org\n\n adfs.wada-awa[.]org\n\n After taking a look at the name server information for the domains, we\n\n identi�ed that wada-awa[.]org was registered and uses a name server\n\n from ITitch[.]com, a domain registrar that FANCY BEAR actors recently\n\n used to register a domain for operations against the Democratic\n\n Congressional Campaign Committee\n\n [https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/] .\n\n Wada-arna[.]org and tas-cass[.]org were registered through and use\n\n name servers from Domains4bitcoins[.]com, a registrar that has also\n\n been associated [https://threatconnect.com/blog/whats-in-a-name\n server/] with FANCY BEAR activity. Concentrations of FANCY BEAR\n\n domains have been found on the name servers for both of these\n\n registrars, and the registrars’ acceptance of anonymous Bitcoin\n\n payment is desirable for actors seeking to avoid attribution. The\n\n diamond model\n\n [https://www.threatconnect.com/platform/methodology/] below shows\n\n\n-----\n\n###### hosting information, known FANCY BEAR TTPs, and intended targets.\n\n The WADA and CAS-spoo�ng domains and activity most likely are\n\n intended to support Russian government intelligence collection and/or\n\n in�uence operations related to the WADA and CAS. Our assessment is\n\n based on the following �ndings:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### g g\n\n consistent with the timeline in which the WADA recommended\n\n banning all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic\n\n games.\n\n 2. The use of 1&1 mail.com webmail addresses to register domains\n\n matches a TTP we previously identi�ed\n\n [https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant\n scratch/] for FANCY BEAR actors.\n\n 3. These domains were registered through ititch[.]com and\n\n domains4bitcoins[.]com, two registrars that accept Bitcoins for\n\n payments. The use of such registrars also matches an identi�ed\n\n [https://threatconnect.com/blog/whats-in-a-name-server/] TTP for\n\n FANCY BEAR actors. Two of our previous blog posts also highlighted\n\n domains at the ITitch [https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it\n itch-they-cant-scratch/] and Domains4bitcoins\n\n [https://threatconnect.com/blog/whats-in-a-name-server/] name\n\n servers and their associations to FANCY BEAR activity.\n\n A review of recently registered domains using the same name servers\n\n identi�ed two other domains related to sports and athletics -- espn\n com[.]co and espn-live[.]co. Espn-live.co was registered through ITitch\n\n on August 17. Espn-com[.]co was registered through ITitch on August 2,\n\n a day before wada-awa[.]org was registered through the same service.\n\n These domains no longer use ITitch name servers as both most likely\n\n were taken over by MarkMonitor on ESPN’s behalf shortly after they\n\n were registered. No information on the original registrants could be\n\n identi�ed and we do not have any indication that these domains were\n\n used maliciously; however, based on the timing, subject matter, and\n\n registrar used, this may represent an additional avenue through which\n\n the actors intended to pursue WADA and CAS-related targets.\n\n#### Anonymous Poland - What’s Their Role?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### anti-doping-agency-site-hacked/] broke the story that the WADA and\n\n CAS had been hacked and thousands of accounts had been leaked. The\n\n subtitle for the story read: Anonymous Poland Hacked World Anti\n doping Agency and Court of Arbitration for sport’s server’ server and\n\n leaked personal details for God knows what reason!\n\n We asked ourselves that very question - what beef does Anonymous\n\n Poland (@anpoland [https://twitter.com/anpoland] ) have with WADA\n\n and CAS? While it is plausible that the attacks were in response to the\n\n Tomasz Zielinski being sent home [http://www.reuters.com/article/us\n olympics-rio-weightlifting-pole-idUSKCN10K1Y2] for testing positive for a\n\n banned steroid nandrolone on August 9, such retaliation e�orts are\n\n atypical for Anonymous Poland, which has previously focused\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/AnonPLorg/] on Polish politics and\n\n perceived issues with the �nancial, political, and media industries. To\n\n that end, is it possible that @anpoland is another platform that Russians\n\n are using to hide their hand in activity against the WADA and CAS?\n\n\n**W H I T E P A P E R : M A T U R I N G A T H R E A T I N T E L L I G E N C E P R O G R A M**\n\n**[ H T T P : / / H U B S . L Y / H 0 3 S N J H 0 ]**\n\n\n###### Of course, activity against WADA and CAS from hacktivists and Russian\n\n state sponsored actors are not mutually exclusive, so it is entirely\n\n possible that two groups could have targeted and/or compromised\n\n these organizations at the same time. However, the timing associated\n\n with the Russian phishing activity and Anonymous Poland’s claims are\n\n very coincidental and suggest that the two may be involved. To that end,\n\n we reviewed Anonymous Poland’s activities to determine whether they\n\n are whom they claim to be. Our �ndings include the following:\n\n 1. @anpoland posted a video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?\n\n v=day5Aq0bHsA] to Youtube that demonstrates how they\n\n purportedly used Acunetix to scan the CAS website and SQLMap\n\n\n-----\n\n###### video shows the individual using a local admin account with Polish\n\n language settings. However, when the individual uses Firefox, we\n\n see in their browser history that they have previously issued Google\n\n searches from Google.ru (Russia) and Google.com (US) multiple\n\n times while Google.pl (Poland) is absent.\n\n Google.ru within the browser history might indicate that the user that\n\n created the Youtube video is originating, or has previously originated,\n\n from a Russian IP address. Although the user has Tor browser on their\n\n desktop it appears as if they failed to execute it, as it does not appear as\n\n an executing process during the hack demo.\n\n WADA Browser History [https://youtu.be/day5Aq0bHsA?t=282]\n\n TAS Browser History [https://www.youtube.com/watch?\n\n v=day5Aq0bHsA&feature=youtu.be&t=296]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1. The @anpoland Twitter account being cited by various news outlets\n\n as a source for this story, appears to have been inactive until the\n\n end of July 2016.\n\n 1. The @anpoland account was established in April 2010, the\n\n same timeframe as when Polish Air Force Flight 101\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu\n 154_crash] crashed several hundred meters short of the\n\n Smolensk airport runway in dense fog, killing everyone on\n\n board, including Polish President Kaczyński. Russia’s �nal\n\n report on the incident blamed the late president and his\n\n “inebriated” air force commander-in-chief for the accident.\n\n 2. Beginning on August 1, the @anpoland account essentially\n\n resurfaced with claims that it had hacked the Ukrainian\n\n Ministry of Internal A�airs and released hacked documents\n\n pertaining at gmarine.com[.]ua - a Ukrainian website hosted\n\n on a Russian IP.\n\n 3. It’s important to note that while the @anpoland account has a\n\n gap in posts from 2010 to 2016, it is possible the individual(s)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2. Other social media accounts claiming a�liation with Anonymous\n\n Poland, such as @anonpoland [https://twitter.com/anonpoland],\n\n and Anonymous’ main twitter account\n\n [https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/] are not publicizing the WADA\n\n compromise. The inability to con�rm the @anpoland and HackRead\n\n story with several additional Anonymous Poland-related sources is\n\n suspect.\n\n 1. Anonymous Poland Facebook\n\n [https://www.facebook.com/AnonPLorg/] accounts identi�ed\n\n to date are focused on internal Polish politics and current\n\n events, apart from some posts referencing ISIS, most of the\n\n communications released call for action (mostly peaceful\n\n physical protests) in response to perceived issues with the\n\n �nancial, political, and media industries in the country.\n\n At this time, based on a lack of sources, we cannot conclude that\n\n @anpoland is another platform that Russian actors are using for\n\n in�uence operations. However, mounting circumstantial evidence that\n\n negate @anpoland’s claimed origins makes us skeptical that they are in\n\n fact a legitimate Anonymous hacktivist group.\n\n#### Fancy Bear’s Roid Rage\n\n###### Ultimately, successful operations against WADA and CAS stakeholders\n\n could yield Russia with intelligence that could facilitate the following:\n\n 1. Follow-on operations seeking to in�uence or coerce individuals in\n\n key decision-making positions within those organizations. Such\n\n in�uence might ultimately result in decisions from those\n\n organizations that bene�t Russian athletes.\n\n 2. Document or data collection that can be used in in�uence\n\n operations or propaganda derisive to the WADA, CAS, or their\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. Follow-on operations targeting speci�c individuals to gain additional\n\n collection.\n\n 4. Intelligence collection that informs Russian e�orts to circumvent\n\n doping and testing procedures, like those described in the McLaren\n\n Report.\n\n 5. Publicly intimidate other potential whistleblowers and deter them\n\n from coming forward.\n\n As evidenced in the Stepanova compromise [https://www.wada\n ama.org/en/media/news/2016-08/wada-con�rms-illegal-activity-on\n yuliya-stepanovas-adams-account], we would also expect to see\n\n additional Russian cyber operations targeting Professor McLaren and\n\n the main source of the investigation, Dr. Rodchenkov. Collection against\n\n these individuals could also facilitate Russian e�orts like those\n\n previously listed, or e�ort to conduct in�uence operations that privately\n\n intimidate or publicly cast those individuals in a negative light.\n\n Russian activity targeting these organizations is an important example\n\n of how Russia responds to wide-reaching current events that have\n\n negative implications for Moscow. Organizations involved in such events\n\n can reasonably expect to experience targeted Russian cyber operations\n\n that ultimately facilitate retaliatory in�uence or propaganda e�orts\n\n against them. Knowledge of this TTP, and others associated with\n\n Russian APT activity, can help those organizations augment their\n\n security posture and defend against such retaliation.\n\n ThreatConnect would very much like to work with WADA and Yuliya\n\n Stepanova if either would be open to sharing any details to help us\n\n better understand the details surrounding this event feel free to contact\n\n us.\n\n Read the full series of ThreatConnect posts following the DNC\n\n Breach: “Rebooting Watergate: Tapping into the Democratic National\n\n\n-----\n\n###### democratic-national-committee/] ”, “Shiny Object?
