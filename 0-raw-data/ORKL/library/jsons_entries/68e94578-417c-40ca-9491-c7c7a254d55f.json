    "plain_text": "# POS and Credit Cards: In the Line of Fire with “PunkeyPOS”\n\n**pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/malware/punkeypos/**\n\nJune 23, 2016\n\n**PandaLabs,** [Panda Security’s anti-malware laboratory, has been working on an in-depth](https://www.pandasecurity.com/)\ninvestigation since May related to Point of Sale terminals (POS) in restaurants across the\nUnited States. A new malware sample was discovered during this investigation called\n**PunkeyPOS, a malware variant that is able to access credit card data. PandaLabs left**\nthis information at the disposal of American law enforcement so they can take the\nappropriate actions. Let’s see what this is and how it operates.\n\n### How can they steal your card without touching your wallet?\n\nPunkeyPOS runs seamlessly in all Windows operating systems. The cyber-criminal’s plan is\nto install the malware in POS terminals in order to steal sensitive information such as\naccount numbers, magnetic strip contents (tracks) from bank cards, etc.\n\n**PunkeyPOS seems simple:**\n\n\n-----\n\nIt installs a keylogger that is responsible for monitoring keystrokes, then it installs a RAM_scraper that is responsible for reading the memory of all processes running on the system._\n\nBased on the information it captures, the malware performs a series of controls to determine\nwhat is valid and what isn’t. Regarding the keystrokes, PunkeyPOS ignores all information\nother than credit card data. It is mostly interested in tracks1/2 from the process memory that\nis obtained from RAM-scraping. The POS terminals read this information from the bank\ncards’ magnetic strips and then can use this data to clone the cards at a later time.\n\nOnce the relevant information has been obtained, it is encrypted and forwarded to a remote\nweb server which is also the command and control (C&C) server. In order to avoid the\ndetection of the card information in case somebody is scanning the network traffic, it is\nencrypted before it is sent using the AES algorithm.\n\nThe command and control (C&C) server address can be easily obtained based on this\nmalware sample through reverse engineering or analyzing their communications. This is the\nmain page of the control panel; it requires a username and password to get access:\n\n### Follow the Trail to the Digital Pickpocketers\n\nThe cyber-criminals behind this attack haven’t been very careful. Since the server was not\nconfigured correctly, PandaLabs was able to access it without credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause of their neglect, PandaLabs was able to see where PunkeyPOS sends the stolen\ninformation. In addition to being in front of a panel that is used to access the stolen data,\nfrom this panel cybercriminals can reinfect or update current clients (POS bots).\n\nThe version of the analyzed PunkeyPOS sample is hardcoded: “2016-04-01”. If we compare\nthis sample with older versions, some from 2014, we can barely see any difference in the\nway it operates (in the References section of this article you can find links that will go further\ninto detail about how it works.)\n\nPandaLabs has been able to gain access to the control panel of PunkeyPOS, and has\ngeolocated around 200 Point of Sale terminals that were compromised by this specific\nmalware variant. We can see that virtually all the victims are in the United States:\n\n\n-----\n\nTaking into account how easy it is to sell this information on the black market, and how\nconvenient it is to compromise these POS terminals anonymously through the internet, we\nare certain that cyber-criminals will be increasingly drawn to these terminals.\n\nProtect your devices proactively from these types of attacks with an advanced cyber**security solution like** [Adaptive Defense.
