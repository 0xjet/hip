You can recognize this ransomware and its version, by the extension it appends\nto the encrypted files and/or ransom-note:\n\n**Versio** **Extension** **Ransom-note Info**\n**n**\n\n1 .GDCB ---= GANDCRAB =---, ……………. the extension: .GDCB\n\n2 .GDCB ---= GANDCRAB =---, ……………. the extension: .GDCB\n\n3 .CRAB ---= GANDCRAB V3 =--- ……….. the extension: .CRAB\n\n4 .KRAB ---= GANDCRAB V4 =--- ……….. the extension: .KRAB\n\n5 .([A-Z]+) ---= GANDCRAB V5.0 =--- …...…. the extension: .UKCZA\n---=  GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =--- …. the extension: .YIAQDG\n---=  GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =--- …. the extension: .CQXGPMKNR\n---=  GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =--- …. the extension: .HHFEHIOL\n\nIn order for this recovery solution to work, you are required at least 1 available\nransom-note on your PC. The ransom-note is required to recover the decryption key. Please\nmake sure that you do not run a clean-up utility which detects and removes these\nransom-notes prior to execution of this tool. The information inside the ransom-notes, taken\nas input for the key-recovery procedure, may look in one of the two ways, shown below.\nJudging by this information, GandCrab ransomware had a significant shift since January\n2018, which relates to encryption mechanism.\n\nGandCrab V1,V2,V3:\n\n|Versio n|Extension|Ransom-note Info|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|.GDCB|---= GANDCRAB =---, ……………. the extension: .GDCB|\n|2|.GDCB|---= GANDCRAB =---, ……………. the extension: .GDCB|\n|3|.CRAB|---= GANDCRAB V3 =--- ……….. the extension: .CRAB|\n|4|.KRAB|---= GANDCRAB V4 =--- ……….. the extension: .KRAB|\n|5|.([A-Z]+)|---= GANDCRAB V5.0 =--- …...…. the extension: .UKCZA ---= GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =--- …. the extension: .YIAQDG ---= GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =--- …. the extension: .CQXGPMKNR ---= GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =--- …. the extension: .HHFEHIOL|\n\n\n-----\n\nGandCrab V4,V5\n\nThe shift of the ransomware was about using a different encryption type and, and if\nversions 1,2,3 of the ransomware used AES-256-CBC, versions 4 and 5 use Salsa20.\n\nThe ransomware kept constant the encryption flow, but considered the damages they\nhave done to files exceeding 4GB in their first versions, and now they only encrypt at most\n1MB.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Steps for decryption:**\n\n**Step 1: Download the decryption tool from ​**\n**[http://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe](http://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe)**\nand save it somewhere on your computer\n\n_This tool ​REQUIRES ​an active internet connection as our servers will attempt to reply the_\n_submitted ID with a possible valid RSA-2048 private key. If this step succeeds the decryption_\n_process will continue._\n\n**Step 2: Double-click the file (previously saved as BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe) and allow it to ​**\nrun by clicking Yes in the UAC prompt.\n\n**Step 3: Select “I Agree” for the End User License Agreement ​**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Step 4: Select “Scan Entire System” if you want to search for all encrypted files or just add**\nthe path to your encrypted files.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you also select “Backup files​ ” before starting the decryption​\nprocess. Then press “Scan”.\n\nRegardless of whether you check the “Backup files” option or not, the decryption tool\nattempts to decrypt ​5 files in the provided path and will NOT continue if the test is not\nsuccessfully passed. The chances that something goes wrong are actually low, however we\nmake these supplementary checks to make sure that nothing goes wrong nor on your, nor\nour side. This approach may not suits some testers, which might want to decrypt 1-2 files at\nmost, or not conforming file extensions. Users may also check the “Overwrite existing clean\nfiles” option under “Advanced options” so the tool will overwrite possible present clean files\nwith their decrypted equivalent.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please contact us at [forensics@bitdefender.com​](mailto:forensics@bitdefender.com) .​\nIf you checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted\nfiles. You can also find a log describing decryption process, in ​%temp%\\BDRemovalTool\nfolder:\n\nTo get rid of your left encrypted files, just search for files matching the extension and\nremove them bulk. We do not encurage you to do this, unless you doubled check your files\ncan be opened safely and there is no trace of damage.\n\n**Silent execution (via cmdline)**\n\nThe tool also provides the possibility of running silently, via a command line. If you need to\nautomate the deployment of the tool inside a large network, you might want to use this feature.\n\n**●** **-help ​- will provide information on how to run the tool silently (this information will**\nbe written in the log file, not on console)\n\n**●** **start​ - this argument allows the tool to run silently (no GUI)**\n\n**●** -​path​ - this argument specifies the path to scan\n\n**●** **o0:1 ​- will enable ​Scan entire system ​option (ignoring ​-path​ argument)**\n\n**●** **o1:1​ - will enable ​Backup files ​option**\n\n**●** **o2:1​ - will enable ​Overwrite existing files ​option**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe start -path:C:\\ ​-> the tool will start with no GUI and scan ​C:\\**\n**BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe start o0:1 ​-> the tool will start with no GUI and scan entire**\nsystem\n**BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe start o0:1 o1:1 o2:1 ​-> the tool will scan the entire system,**\n\nbackup the encrypted files and overwrite present clean files\n\n**Acknowledgement: ​**\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the\n[OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/​](http://www.openssl.org/) ) ​\n\n\n-----",
